The London West Hollywood at Beverly Hills,Staycation #23,"The London remains one of the best well known secrets of Our City, Lady of Angels. This hotel is exactly where to stay in LA. Great location, impeccable service, DOG FRIENDLY!! Insanely clean grounds and beautiful rooms, sanitizer EVERYWHERE. Rooftop pool is open and worth a visit. What can I say? We LEGIT cannot get enough of this place, after 9 years it’s still one of the greatest and grandest in LA. ",50,February 2021
The London West Hollywood at Beverly Hills,Hidden paradise ," The moment we pulled up the valet and bellman where to greet us both where super friendly and professional, this was the beginning of our fabulous experience. Sheela checked us in and was extremely efficient and friendly and had us in our room within 10 mins. The room was spotless, big and airy with an amazing view. Up at the pool (which is spectacular) we where waited on by Howard he was so nice and helpful when it came to choosing food and drinks, also Austin makes a mean Bloody Mary ;) The complementary breakfast is delicious, our server Robert was extremely attentive and cheery. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel, everyone we came in contact with where so professional, helpful & friendly and really made us feel special, it feel like a home away form home. I will most definitely",50,March 2021

The London West Hollywood at Beverly Hills,Staycation,"In the time of Covid much travel is not wise, but my girlfriend and I stayed at the London West Hollywood this past weekend and it was a slice of heaven. The staff went above and beyond to treat us like royalty without being pushy or invasive. The views were spectacular and the rooms...well roomy. I would definitely stay here again and actually look doers to coming back. ",50,February 2021
Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,"Great location, good business hotel","This hotel offered great service and facilities during my stay, convenient to the city centre .  I also had great hospitality from Alberto who was extremely helpful on the reservations desk , who offered the best customer service",50,February 2021
Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,Perfect  choice  of hotel in a quiet and safe area,I have stayed in various hotels in London and the Copthorne Tara Kensington  is most  certainly  the very best. I travel  constantly  for business and the hotel from start to finish  exceeds all my expectations. From first arrival the entrance feels grand which leads into a huge well lit  and extremely  clean lobby and reception with a comfortable lounge area for relaxing. There are numerous  hand sanitizer stations and during covid I noticed on arrival all staff and front of house were wearing  masks aswell  as guests who wear masks in the lobby areas which made me feel comfortable. The hotel is extremely  clean in all areas.  I particularly  enjoy the quietness of the hotel.Just 5 minutes  walk from Kensington  high street though tucked away from any noise. The rooms are in my,50,February 2021
Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,"Elegant Hotel, Good Service & Prime Location!!","I love this hotel a lot! The location is perfect, near the High Street Kensington tube. Lots of cafes and restaurants nearby. Also can go for a walk to the famous hyde park in a short walking distance!   The receptionists and polite and helpful. Also, the cleaning service is satisfactory! The hotel and room design are beautiful and elegant! The view is stunning facing the west side with higher floors! Very nice experience! Highly recommended!",50,January 2021
Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,"Convenient long term stay, amazing staff","We stayed at this hotel for several months during lockdown and enjoyed every day of it. The room was spacious and bright, with a lot of closet space, a safe, electric kettle, and a relatively large fridge (for usual hotel standards) which all came very convenient during our long term stay. In the lobby, there's even a microwave which guests can use. The bed was large and very comfortable. Nice views over the West of London. Furniture and fittings was not brand new but all in all it was very good value for money. It is the staff which made our stay very special and made us feel almost at home far away from home. From the front desk to the kitchen and service to the cleaning and maintenance, the staff is very welcoming and highly professional. Even our special wishes for food were",50,February 2021
Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,Nobody Wearing Masks,None of the guests sitting or walking around the communal lobby and seating areas were wearing masks even though there were signs up everywhere requesting people to wear them. Even some of the staff had their masks placed under their chins. Management and staff should tell people to keep their masks on at all times to keep everyone safe as it's mandatory to wear masks indoors in public areas.,10,January 2021
Sofitel London Gatwick Hotel,Great hotel and restaurant,"I had a great stay! My flight to Orlando over London was delayed - thank God! I was very happy with this hotel they gave me, the check in was absolutely easy and fast, the staff is nice and the room was clean and neat. The lobby is very spacious and airy, which I love. I had vouchers and used one for the dinner at the restaurant and the tomato pasta was the best food I ever had!!!  I was a great experience and I'd rather have stayed longer than to take the flight the next day.",50,July 2020
Sofitel London Gatwick Hotel,Excellent stay as always,"I love staying at this hotel.  Always feel welcome on arrival.  Rooms are comfortable and clean.  For our most recent stay in January we discovered at check in we were the ""guest of the day"" as a result of which we got an upgrade giving us access to the exec level lounge.  We were taken to our room and shown around by the manager of guest relations.  She was fantastic.  So once again, thanks Sofitel Gatwick.  I am already planning my next stay at the hotel.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",50,January 2020
Sofitel London Gatwick Hotel,Not as expected,We have stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions with no problems but this time our sleep quality was very poor.  The room was so hot and the feather duvet was hot and heavy.  Also there was a feather mattress topper which was lumpy and uncomfortable.  End result was a maximum of only a few hours of sleep.  The bathroom floor was dirty and needed cleaning.  Fortunately we ordered breakfast early so we left as soon as we could.  We travel as much as we are able but I would definitely think twice before staying again.,30,January 2021
Sofitel London Gatwick Hotel,The worst service I ever seen,"Unfortunately I just had the worst experience in this hotel. One night it’s enough to realise, it took them 3 HOURS to check me in as it was around 100 people at the queue. When it was almost my turn a lady came out from reception saying that they have no more rooms so they weren’t able to check us in. After other lady in my same situation threatened them to call the police... bum! Magically they found room for all of us...   Once I could get into my room around 9,30 pm. (I came to the hotel at 5,30 pm) I’ve tried to order some dinner. Room service phone was busy all the time so I had to come down to reception to place my order. After 1:30 minutes waiting for just 1 pizza I decide to call again and what was my surprise? The man on the phone said that I didn’t place any order and",10,January 2021
Sofitel London Gatwick Hotel,Had to be changed to 3 different rooms,"When we arrived, we had to be moved 2 times. The first room we were given was half clean. The bathroom was dirty. There was garbage everhwere. The second room was filled with ciggarette smoke. When we went to give in the test the front desk was extremely rude and took a long time to come help us even though there was no one there.",20,December 2020

Travelodge London Covent Garden,Best Travelodge in London,"I stayed here for five nights and have zero complaints. The staff were brilliant, especially during this pandemic. The hotel was clean and my room spacious. WiFi worked well. The location is fantastic - right in the heart of Covent Garden.",50,December 2020
Travelodge London Covent Garden,Good not Great,"Very convenient location , fantastic staff who are very friendly and helpful , and really clean and well laid out rooms. Also , prices are very sensible for the rooms and £3 a day to top up the 30 minutes of free wi-fi tjat comes as standard is also very fair. Of course covid restrictions meant no bar or dining and i really missed sutting down and having a nice cooked  breakfast To make it a better experience it would be great to have the option of sky/bt sports / netflix etc in the rooms , especially with all the pubs closed. I would say the walls are thin so sometimes you can hear your neighbours noises , and one or two of the rooms that are in the corners or angles of the building are odd shapes so badly configured to be able to use the desks properly.",40,February 2021
Travelodge London Covent Garden,One of the best Travelodges,Friendly and helpful staff. Rooms recently decorated/renovated. I was with my disabled son in a wheelchair and staff were very helpful and considerate. Access for a wheelchair is via a ramp at side of building that is quite steep so must have strong arms or someone to assist wheelchair users! ,50,February 2021
Travelodge London Covent Garden,Perfect base for business trip or explore London. Eleonora and Marina were excellent.,"The reception was warm and wonderful for business travellers especially considering the tough times the hotel industry is facing.  Eleonora and Marina were very accommodating and amazingly helpful.    The room is superb in terms of cleanliness which is utmost priority during these uncertain times of pandemic.  Ample space, clean shower, little details on tea/coffee provision completes the experience.  The location is a perfect and secure 5 minute walk to nearby Holborn station with plenty of local cafes offering take away food.  There are also vending machines for those late night snacks so no need to venture out in the cold and dark during those late night conference meetings.  The bar/cafe, albeit currently closed, looks a great place to hang out with your friends.  Once",50,February 2021
Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,Its the little things....,I had such an amazing experience in park plaza yesterday. As i checked in i was given chocolate and was wished a happy international womens day and even given a really nice room. Its hard times at the moment so these little touches are so nice. Cant wait to come back during summer,50,March 2021
Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,Need to go back!,"We stayed at the Park Plaza recently as we had some work done to our home. We live in London and we wanted to stay central. I can't fault this hotel and our experience was truly beyond what we expected. FIrst off, the location is excellent! You are located literally across Westminster Bridge, and if available, you can request a room with views onto Westminster Bridge, Big Ben and Parliament. If you love walking, you can walk to Trafalgar Square, and even Piccadilly Circus. It would take you less than 20 minutes I believe. You are also a few minutes away from London Eye. There are cool and trendy restaurants all around, and your local shops like M&S and Boots are just around the corner. Waterlook Station is a 5 minute walk,so you truly have everything on your doorstep.  We stay",50,February 2021
Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,ICU Redeployment,I stayed here during my ICU redeployment and it helped me massively as work was just a 3 minute walk. The food was good and never arrived late.

Premier Inn London County Hall hotel,Exemplary for all the wrong reasons....,"This Premier Inn is at the pinnacle of its game. The greeting from the front of house staff and duty manager, in particular, is astonishingly consistent. Anyone in the hospitality industry should look at this hotel as exemplary in how not to deliver customer service. My family and friends have experienced this exceptional low quality over several visits. Due to our last visit free diving to a whole new level of unhelpful attitude and rudeness, we have discovered a world of inspiring, joyful welcoming people who are genuinely pleased that you chose their hotel for your London layover. All within a stone's throw of this hotel and at reasonable rates.  A list of endless failings and disappointment sums this hotel up.   London and every other city for that matter are full of lovely",10,October 2020
Premier Inn London County Hall hotel,Lovely hotel!,"Lovely hotel, we had one of the premier rooms and this didn't dissapoint at all, spacious, clean and with a lovely view over the London Eye.  Completely central to Waterloo train station and tube, with Westminster tube a five minute walk away.  Hotel staff were helpful and friendly with everything.  My only criticism was the scrambled eggs for breakfast were far too mashed and runny.... resembled porridge more than eggs.  Overall, lovely hotel, would highly recommend 👌 ",50,October 2020
Premier Inn London County Hall hotel,Cold room,Nice place having stayed a few times very disappointed this time the room temperature was set to 17 degrees who lives at 17 degrees our home temperature is 21 degrees so you can see we were very disappointed sorry to have to say but it must be said we will think twice about staying again this time of year,10,November 2020
Premier Inn London County Hall hotel,Nice location but noisy ,Stayed one night with daughter as treat away. Perfect location for where we wanted to go however did not appreciate being woken up by outside noise at 7am! When we checked out there was no one there on the desk so I couldn’t complain as I’m sure there is a money back Guarantee if crap nights sleep??  Have to pay extra if you want a good view so dint expect to get a good view of you book a twin . Apparently all the good rooms are doubles! Breakfast was ok however busy and my bacon was cold however they did get me hot fresh bacon . Lots of choice for breakfast and bonus kids eat free so well worth the money ! They stored our luggage for free which was good as our room Wasn’t ready till gone 4pm and not 2pm as it says on website ! ,30,October 2020
Premier Inn London County Hall hotel,18th birthday trip,"Having just returned from a 1 night day, we couldn’t have been happier. We had planned a trip to London for my sons 18th birthday. Obviously at the moment London is a bargain and this hotel at £55 for the night plus breakfast for the room was great. I called earlier in the week to ask that both my Childrens room And ours were next to each other or close by. The gentleman amended it all for me and we were next door. Both of our rooms had two double beds and massive amounts of room. As usual for PI the hotel was clean, and comfortable. We paid for the breakfast which was great. The waitress took our order.  We all indicated what and how much of each item we’d like along with croissants etc.  I shall definitely be booking another room b4 they go back to their normal price 😉",50,October 2020
Park Plaza County Hall London,Contemporary room and wonderful staff,"In this slightly odd Covid landscape the Park Plaza has got its customer relations right. I was very kindly upgraded and given a very comfortable room with a view of the fantastic London skyline. The staff couldn't have been more welcoming, helpful and accommodating especially Attila on the front desk. They had to manage with restricted access, fewer people but all of this was managed with style and charm.",50,March 2021
Park Plaza County Hall London,Thank you Park Plaza County Hall,"A massive thank you to Park Plaza for rescuing a stranded Northerner when the hotel I had originally booked for work was closed down and I wasn't informed until I had got there. The staff at County Hall booked me in very last minute and were so welcoming and accommodating. The room was clean and in line with current circumstances and all social distancing measures were spot on. A special thank you to Niall, Attilla and Sarah. I will definitely be returning.",50,March 2021

Park Plaza County Hall London,Old and needs a revamp,"If you book a penthouse don’t accept room 1408. I don’t know about other “Penthouses” but 1408 isn’t. It’s like calling your 10year old house cat a Lion. It’s not big, beautiful and impressive but old tired and small. ",20,January 2021
Park Plaza County Hall London,"Best hotel in london, staff rated 10.","Best hotel in london, team rated 10. We were very well attended, view was excellent, internet great, staff spoke portuguese, they gave us several good tips, since london was closed, we liked it a lot.",50,January 2021
Premier Inn London Euston hotel,Warning. This hotel is refusing to refund,"I  booked this hotel, among several others in the UK and Italy, for travel in August 2020.  Unfortunately, I was forced to cancel my entire 6 week trip due to Australian Government travel restrictions preventing me from leaving the country for the foreseeable future.  All the other properties I booked have either provided a full refund for my pre-paid accommodation, or a credit voucher for future travel. Premier Inn Euston is the ONLY hotel to have refused to offer a workable solution. Instead of acknowledging the circumstances surrounding my cancellation are clearly out of my control, they have taken advantage of the situation and pocketed the pre-paid room rate. I am beyond disgusted at their lack of customer service, their blatant disregard for my situation and for leaving me",10,August 2020
Premier Inn London Euston hotel,"Business stay, amazing location",with Premier Inn you know what you get. I have stayed multiple times. Great location next to train station Euston and tube stop. Bedrooms have comfy Premier Inn beds. It has a pub with great atmosphere. Receptiin staff go out of the way to assist you. Highly recommended. Outsanding value for money,50,February 2020
Premier Inn London Euston hotel,PREMIER INN NEED TO UPGRADE CUSTOMER SERVICE,Very poor service unable to contact customer service  they responded very slowly and couldn't get through on phone . Unable to travel due to Covid.  Couldn't rate as 0... last response said hope to have you stay with us what a joke,10,August 2020
Premier Inn London Euston hotel,No Sympathy for Bookings Forced to Cancel due to Covid,"I am a Travel Agent who booked this hotel for a client due to travel in September but who wasn't able to due to the pandemic and Australian travel restrictions banning non-essential travel. Having dealt with nearly 100 hotels for various clients with the same issue, this was the ONLY hotel who refused to provide a workable solution. They didn't even offer credit for a future booking, just pocketed the cash and gave nothing in return. Unconscionable! Clearly we aren't ALL IN THIS TOGETHER!!",10,September 2020
Premier Inn London Euston hotel,Covid -Filthy,"This has unbelievably dusty carpets. Premier Inn's Covid policy is not to clean rooms.  Go figure.

Pullman London St Pancras Hotel,Amazing experience at a well run and wonderfully staffed central London hotel.,"After a nightmare week of collapsing ceilings and being forced to couch surf for a week I finally snapped and booked a night in a hotel just to get some time for myself and to sleep in a proper bed.   I picked Pullman because it was competitively priced and a little more stylish than the budget hotels. I could have spent half the price and stayed in a Travelodge or budget hotel but I wanted somewhere with some character, a proper sized bed and a sauna if I wanted to use it. I guess I wanted to treat myself after a sh**ty week.   The hotel didn't disappoint at all! The lobby, reception and bar is stylish and new. Everything flowed and checking in was quick and easy. Of course I stayed during the pandemic and a week before Lockdown 2.0 kicked in so it was quiet but the staff were",50,October 2020
Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,No sleep and certainly no 'Good night Guarantee'!,"Woken up during the night multiple times due to the sound of the aircon system (see video) and to make matters worse the shower didnt work either! I tried to speak to someone on reception but there was no one there when I checked out and upon calling so called 'guest relations' after was told that I should have tried to change rooms at 3am!!!  Utterly appalling service from all, I'd avoid premier inn at the moment as you simply dont know what you're getting.",10,December 2020
Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,Second stay here,"Second time we've stayed here but thought a covid review might be helpful to others considering going in these strange times. Hotel is in a great location. Felt really safe in terms of covid, lots of cleaning going on in communal areas. All meals need table reservations, even if you've booked and paid for them. We saw a few people turned away due to not booking a timed slot - not sure how as PI email several times to remind you beforehand. It actually made breakfast much more tolerable to my Autistic son, who can find busy eateries overwhelming - it was very relaxing. We stayed for 3 nights and the rooms are not cleaned until you check out, that wasn't an issue to us and reception can give you extra supplies should you need any. As always, the staff were super friendly and",50,October 2020
Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,Excellent place,"We stayed here for three nights and had a very good stay. The first room we had the toilet didn't flush properly so we mentioned it to the lady on reception and she moved us straight away. The second room we had was bigger, lovely comfortable bed, clean white bedding and towels, room very clean. We asked for extra coffee, milk, sugar which was delivered to our room whilst we were out. All staff were very friendly, helpful and looked like they enjoyed their job. Would highly recommend and will hopefully return there when next in London.

Qbic Hotel London City,"Clean, modern, eco-friendly, and helpful staff","I stayed for two nights alone and it was exceptional.

Qbic Hotel London City,Lovely modern and charming!,"I stayed at the Qbic hotel for a couple nights and I had the most amazing time. The entire staff was  helpful and welcoming and very lovely. Especially Cristina at the reception whom I promised I'd write this review.   Apart from one incident with a manager slightly too eager to create an incident where there wasn't one.

Sea Containers London,NHS heroes stay,"I was very lucky to win a free stay here as my husband recommended me as an ""NHS hero"" for working as a junior doctor during the pandemic. Firstly, very generous to offer over 500 free rooms and breakfasts! Now we did wonder if there would be a reduction in service, because we were getting the night for free, so didn't need to be treated the same as paying guests, but this was absolutely not the case! Fantastic service from even before we checked in (we were supposed to have dinner in their restaurant but sadly there was terrible traffic in London and we didn't get there until 2 hours later than expected and the restaurant was closed). They were very accomodating as I contacted them repeatedly from the car, and didn't charge me a penalty for not making the dinner reservation as",50,October 2020
Sea Containers London,Wonderful service from Ishmael.,"Visited on the 15th December 2020 with a dear friend who took me out to dinner. The service was impeccable and our waiter was called Ishmael.

Absolutely excellent service and the food was great too. The ambiance was good as social distancing was in place. Next time I’ll request a River front dining spot. We were inside next to the window which was great. Wonderful restaurant. Five stars.",50,December 2020

Sea Containers London,Our Honeymoon,"We came straight from our wedding and couldn't have been greeted by more welcoming and helpful people. Joe the guest experience manager gave us drinks on arrival, upgraded our room and arranged breakfast for us every morning. In such a rubbish situation with Covid, we have had so much stress this year re arranging our wedding etc and staying here you would bearly notice Covid was still a thing (obviously they have safety measures in place) but apart from that it was such a relaxed, enjoyable experience and so lovely to get away from all that stress and anxiety for a couple of days.

The staff was all fantastic, very helpful and kept the drinks flowing while we ate our meal.  Great choice on the Menu, the food was outstanding, very tasteful.  We booked into the Bar later on in the evening due to limited space because of Covid restrictions but did not disappoint.   Rooms was lovely looking over great views of London.  Very clean & cosy.   Breakfast was amazing.  Over looking BlackFrairs Bridge.  Didn’t have any problems with my short stay so I would definitely stay here again & also recommend this hotel to others.

hub by Premier Inn London Covent Garden hotel,Bank holiday weekend during Covid-19 ,"Stayed here for 1 night during bank holiday weekend in August for a birthday weekend visit. I was a bit apprehensive at first staying in a large city in the middle of a pandemic but a weekend break was needed. I had no need to feel apprehensive as the hotel made me feel really safe. The room and lobby area was clean and the hotel wasn’t crowded which put my mind at rest. All staff were wearing masks and social distancing seemed to be in place from what I could see.   The rooms were modern and bright. Whilst the size of the room reminded me very much of my time at student accommodation, you get what you pay for. However it was completely fine for what we needed as we didn’t spend much time in the room. Overall, it’s a perfect place to stay if you want to visit the city on a",50,August 2020

Brilliant location and plenty of places to eat to suit all budgets and tastes nearby. If you like the hub concept then this one ticks all the boxes.  Special mention to well organised COVID measures and the excellent cheerful and friendly staff. A great effort and well done.",50,October 2020
St Giles London,Canceled due to covid. NO RESPONSE!! ,"BE WARNED!.!.! My wife has been Tring to get our refund back from the London St Giles Hotel since December due to Covid and London going into Tier 4. We were due to stay 1 night to see a show in London this show had been cancelled alo g with restricted travel.

I booked this hotel as I was going into the rehabilitation Center at The national hospital for neurology and neurosurgery in queens square on January 5th  ..I had booked for 4th to 5th as I have to be there for 10am ...but this afternoon received an email saying they have cancelled my reservation ... ... definitely will not be booking this hotel in future... ,10,December 2020
St Giles London,Great location. Hotel ok,"Got a great deal on Groupon.  1 night late check out and breakfast for 2 with a drink on arrival.  On arrival I approached the reception. The lady behind the desk took some time to find my booking. She gave me room key said floor 6 and that was that.  No drink, did not tell me anything else.  Later that evening I asked another pm reception staff to verify I was booked in for breakfast. She did confirm and she did say yes to late check out.  Nothing. Mentioned about my drink so I never said nothing.  My bed was a very small double and the room radiator did not work.   Ended up sleeping on the small sofa as the room was warm.   Thanks for the stay. ",40,December 2020
St Giles London,Good location ,"The room we had was small but clean and tidy. No kettle which surprised and disappointed me. Reception polite. Good location, very close to theatres and Oxford Street. Beds were comfy however I barely slept due to very noisy people above us. Shouting, sounded like things constantly being thrown on the floor or doors slamming, all through the night.

"St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel, London",Lovely property and lovely staff,"Hospitality during the pandemic is a huge challenge with most Hotels opting not to remain open for business.

All of the staff were immensely helpful and friendly in every conceivable way from the first moment I arrived until the day I left.  I was so pleased with my stay, which occurred during the tier 4 period in London, that I purchased a room for a family member and his guest to celebrate New Year's Eve there.  And the staff went above-and-beyond for them as well.  I could continue praising the staff and hotel all day.  I will stay there whenever I can.  I suggest you do the same.  ",50,December 2020
"St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel, London",A well located comfortable hotel ,"I know the Taj chain from India, where its flagship property in Bombay is a veritable institution in its own right.  The Taj’s London property, while not on the same scale and without the same range of facilities as the mother ship, is nonetheless a good base for a comfortable stay in the heart of the city.  I stayed there over a long weekend in August, just after the first UK lockdown and the hotel was careful to observe all sanitary protocols.  My room was spacious and comfortable, as was my bathroom.  The gym was well equipped, though sadly the spa was off limits due to the virus.  The service at breakfast was polite and well intentioned, though harried, chaotic and shambolic the first couple of days.  It got much better after I pointed this out to a restaurant manager who",50,August 2020
"St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel, London",Break the routine ,"Because of lockdown the hotel was only running at a basic level. However the staff were so very obliging and helpful. The room was on a corner overlooking the courtyard. I would imagine in the summer this must be a wonderful place to sit and drink. The hotel is an unusual design, spread across a number of buildings.  Unique as with all the Taj hotels. Would recommend. ",50,December 2020
St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,Problems with visit,"We had a few problems when we visited in December 2020, you could put a few of these down to Covid, but we have been to other good hotels this year and a lot of others are still managing to operate an excellent service.  I could probably only give my experience 2 stars, but attention from management staff since, including from Annachiara has been excellent and beyond all reasonable expectations, and we plan to return to the hotel at Easter (Covid permitting) to give it another go. Hence the higher rating.  One thing to bear in mind with the hotel is that a lot of the nice pictures you see online tend to be from the older part of the hotel, however a lot of the rooms are in the Barlow Wing, which is a newer and extended part of the building, we didn't realise this until we went,",40,December 2020
St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,Beautiful Hotel ,"The hotel is exquisite. Seeped in history and amazing Victorian opulence. Our room was superb, bed was comfortable with luxurious linen. The high ceilings and fireplace gave us a sense of space and freedom with majestic flair.   The pool was a real treat and we thoroughly enjoyed it.   Both Nick and Billy were exceptional and are an absolute credit to you. They both understand customer service and know how to make their customers feel special. Nothing was too much trouble and their care and attention to detail was remarkable. Billy gave us a tour of the hotel which we loved as my family are  history fanatics. He kindly lent us a book on the history of the hotel which we thoroughly enjoyed reading in the evenings before returning it to reception.  All the staff were kind, willing",50,December 2020
St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,Beautiful hotel and great service,"This hotel is absolutely stunning. We stayed in the chambers suites and due to covid the usual chambers lounge was closed but they made up for it by giving us a free mini bar, which was great.   The breakfast was lovely , I would deffinitely reccomend the full english,however,service was rather slow. The staff were very apologetic about this and were attentive whilst we waited for food. It seems they had a lot of room service orders that slowed them down.  The room was beautiful with lots of little extras. However, just a small complaint the shower did not get hot, as we only had a short stay I decided not to ask for a room change, but I'm sure this would have been possible.  All in all a lovely stay with very little negatives.",40,December 2020

The hotel couldn’t have done more to accommodate us. Lasilo and his team were brilliant. Particular thanks to Alex on the door who sorted all our luggage, flowers, last minute cabs etc..  this venue is stunning.   Lovely reception meal; canapés followed by heritage tomato tart starter (turns out the vicars father was a tomato scientist so very appropriate), sea bass main, chocolate brownie, cheese and biscuits, sweets and macaroons. Beautiful room - ladies smoking room.   Thank you once again and thanks for the room upgrades.  ",50,November 2020
St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel London,Afternoon Tea,"Lovely venue with fabulous staff. Our waitress Melissa was outstanding. Such a shame the impact Covid having on the leisure & hotel industry.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London -Tower of London,Great location,I stayed there during a weekend in September. It only took me 20mins to get there by taxi from Euston Train Station.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London -Tower of London,Great location ,"Stayed here for one night as part of a birthday trip, whilst we weren’t disappointed but I can’t say I was wowed either. Location was good for the amenities we needed (other hotels in the area). All the staff we encountered were friendly and polite. Several facilities weren’t available which I assume is due to COVID restrictions- including no cookie on arrival. The hotel lacked atmosphere & warmth (again maybe due to restrictions) Our room was pleasant, felt well cleaned with blue door seal to show no contamination which was a reassuring touch. Super soft pillows and snuggling duvet - lovely quiet nights sleep. Water, tea, coffee & biscuits available in the room. Super hot shower and large fluffy towels. Overall good value for money but if I was visiting the area again I’d",30,December 2020
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London -Tower of London,Disappointed,We had to change rooms because the air conditioner pumped cigarette smoke into our room. We tried to go to the restaurant/ bar at 9pm and got turned away for not having a reservation. The hotel itself is mostly empty (we can see from the sealed doors) so people from outside can take all the places from hotel guests. The downstairs bar was also closed and room service not available. So what do we get for the money we paid? A travel lodge quality basic room sold as an “executive suite” and go to bed hungry.,10,December 2020
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London -Tower of London,Great location,"This hotel is located in a good location right in the heart of the city.  While I’ve stayed in the executive room that looks less ‘basic’ in comparison to standard rooms, the furniture looks a bit tired. This is quite surprising, considering that this hotel is quite modern and the receptionist/bar area, as well as the corridors, look quite modern and are in a good condition.  The receptionist that checked me in/out was very friendly and polite. I cannot say the same about other members of staff who did not seem to be in a great mood when I asked for something later in the evening.  The breakfast was rather disappointing as it consisted of a small box filled with few bits.

Hilton London Canary Wharf,Terrific Hotel,"This was my second stay at the Hilton Canary Wharf, and again, it did not disappoint. We were in London for the weekend for my partner's birthday and the hotel is in a great location. Canary Wharf tube station is only a few minutes walk away and all the attractions we had planned were easily accessible.  We stayed in rom 915. Check in was 3pm but when we arrived at 10am to ask if we could leave our luggage we were told our room was ready! It was spotlessly clean with complimentary water and a message and some chocolate from the housekeeping team. There were beautiful 'swan' towels and scattered rose petals on the bed. We arrived back early evening from sightseeing to a birthday message and lovely birthday cupcakes. The room was spacious, the bed comfortable and we didn't hear a",50,March 2020
Hilton London Canary Wharf,Transport and location,"This hotel is blessed with a location close to both the underground and dlr.  Easy to get to canary wharf in less than 5 minutes and a number of places to eat nearby. We parked in the underground car park, but it is limited capacity.  Check in was great as were the staff.  Room was very good and cleaned to a high standard.  Even though we were 13 floors up we were still woken by the trains just after 5am.  If you are a light sleeper get a room at the back. Breakfast was good and a very good set up, very safe as was the hotel bar.  Shame we visited in times of restrictions, but a very safe hotel.",40,October 2020

Hilton London Canary Wharf,Nice Hotel But Too Many Issues,"Firstly on check in offered  a free room upgrade which accepted gladly, at time of booking my stay via the Hilton App ordered a drinks packaged which paid for on arrival so far so good.  Sadly upgraded room while lovely suffered noise from the docklands railway, my original pick would have been further back from the line.  Drinks package never arrived leading me to believe was charged for room upgrade rather then drinks package.  The room had issues, key cards and Mobile digital key failed after 24 hours and had to be rest.  Consulting my credit card app, I found  pending payments for my drinks package and full upgraded room rate.  Had  to contact front desk to insure these charges where not put through and correct charges applied.  Honestly expect more being a Hilton Honors",30,October 2020

I would highly recommend a visit to the Waldorf London...we will certainly be returning.",50,December 2020
The Waldorf Hilton London,Afternoon tea,My word what can I say. Absolutely fantastic. Even asked did we want a square or round table. We choose a round one. The sandwiches came out first each on full of flavour. Then the cakes came out . Each one was presented with so much detail shame to eat them. We had the unlimited champagne package so we were there for about hour and a half.  Well done to the 2 waitress who looked after us. I just hope the photo's do the food justice. ,50,December 2020
The Waldorf Hilton London,Amazing!,"What can I say, from pre-arrival to check out the service was fantastic. Reception team very welcoming and attentive. The room was clean and contemporary with art deco touches! Parrot bar just perfect with the panelled walls and soft jazz in the background. Dinner in the Homage was superb, menu limited due to current climate which is understandable but the service, presentation and of course the setting were second to none. First time visiting this hotel and will certainly be returning. Working in the industry myself I have a critical eye but no fault found here. Special mention to the fabulous Doorman - Douglas.

Hilton London Kensington,Ticks all the boxes,"I had stayed in the hotel a couple of years ago and I wrote a review then. I like this hotel because it ticks all the boxes. Good sized rooms (but see my tip below). It is quite a busy hotel so probably not the thing for someone who needs a quiet hotel.   Breakfast buffet: wide array of great choices, from pastries (croissants, etc) to full English breakfast, to Asian options. All very tasty. They also have small bags at the pastry table in case you want to take a roll up to your room.  Steam room, sauna and gym in the lower ground: excellent. The shower that is in the sauna and steam room area has no curtain. Be careful as there is also a security camera there. I think it is amiss of the hotel not to place a sign there letting guests know about the surveillance camera",50,November 2019

Hilton London Paddington,Lovely grand hotel shame about website,"This is a lovely grand hotel of a bygone era that still remains its charm.  However due to Covid-19 it was eerie to see it so empty and lifeless.  There is no direct access to the London Paddington Railway station, the restaurant is completely closed, there is no Executive Lounge and just one member of staff in reception, trying her best ti make yoy feel most welcome. In this Covid era it seems that Covid is an excuse to rip people off and not provide accurate information on the website.

Hilton London Paddington,Extremely frustrating Covid cancellation attempt ,"Want to share my experience- I’m waiting for the refund of my cancellation (due to COVID) since 6 months. Every time I get a different excuse and a different timeframe on how “soon” it will be resolved. 5 business days or 7 business days and now 30 business days. Completely ridiculous- couldn’t be more unhappy, if there was ever a customer service that deserved 0 stars this is it. Unfortunately this wasn’t an option here so I went with 1 star.  The issue is in equal parts due to the hotel which wasn’t willing to give me a refund at all despite the clear company policy to do so but also Hilton corporate who always promised to resolve it but constantly fails to do so.  I spend endless hours on hotlines, over email and chat with many different reps - all are fast to promise",10,November 2020
Hilton London Paddington,One more bad review ,"Like many recent (and older) reviews I can only add what an extremely disappointing stay we had. As diamond members we were ripped off paying £97 for no Executive lounge, no restaurants, no fitness centre, no direct access to Paddington Station and only one person on the reception desk etc etc. At the price charged we expected these services. The most disappointing thing was that the website refers to ‘reduced’ services, when there were none. This in my opinion amounts to false advertising.   A reduced Executive lounge does not mean no lounge. Reduced restaurants does not meant no restaurants and a reduce breakfast doesn’t mean a boxed breakfast. If it is only a boxed breakfast then say this on your website.   We deliberately stayed here because we planned a relatively early",10,September 2020

Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum,London Visit following Lockdown,Arrived at the hotel mid afternoon and the hotel seemed very quiet. I was checked in by a very helpful receptionist who informed me that the restaurant was closed and breakfast was not available due to Covid.  I was allocated a room on the 5th floor. on opening the door you could immediatly tell the room was compact as the bathroom had a sliding bathroom door. The room was small but adequate and probably in need of a refurb. It was good that you could open the windows to allow for fresh air however as the room was facing Cromwell Road is was very noisy.

The room decor had the feeling of the 1990's and well overdue a refurbishement. With 27 floors, I appreciate this will not be an easy task.

Grand Royale London Hyde Park,Extremely poor customer service,"I prepaid for a three night stay beginning July 31, 2020.  Due to COVID restrictions we were unable to enter the UK.  I contacted the hotel in early June to see if they would offer a refund or voucher under the circumstances.  I was told that if travel restrictions between the US and UK were still in effect in late July then they would give me a voucher that had to be used before March of 2021 - not the best option but I thought I'd try to negotiate with them at that time.  I reached out the them in late July but have not heard anything back from them regarding a voucher.  Lesson learned - I will never make a non-refundable hotel reservation again, and will certainly not use this hotel if I ever make it to London.",10,July 2020
Grand Royale London Hyde Park,This Hotel is CLOSED.,"Booked for 2 nights at this hotel. Arrived to find a scrappy piece of paper on the main door saying it was closed until further notice. It told us to go to another hotel which was allegedly 5 star.....it is not 5 star, it is barely 3 star. Do not book here, it is CLOSED.",10,August 2020
DoubleTree by Hilton London - Westminster,A nice place to stay with a great team,"With hotel stays much reduced these days, it is great to discover a property that is handling the pandemic very well and offers a fair room rate.  DoubleTree by Hilton London – Westminster has an excellent team with positive interactions starting from the greeting on arrival, through check-in, greetings when leaving and entering the property, greetings and assistance at breakfast and checkout.  Many full-service properties could learn from here.  Public areas and the 7th floor refurbished guest room were clean, comfortable and in great condition.  The bed was extremely comfortable, the TV worked as it should, amenities included tea and coffee making facilities, an iron, and a hairdryer.  The only slight issue during the stay was that water leaked from around the inset rainfall",50,December 2020
DoubleTree by Hilton London - Westminster,Perfect,"We travelled down to London from Scotland to celebrate our silver wedding. We stayed in the hotel on b&b rate in a deluxe king room. I emailed ahead of our arrival and asked if it was possible to have a high floor room, and we were given a top floor room with views over london. Brekkie was continental, and even after arriving after 9.30am we were still offered food to go with our coffee - nothing was a problem, the staff are a huge asset to this hotel. On our leaving day we checked out, but left our cases whilst we went for a walk along the embankment, again no probs in doing this. It was on returning that i realised id left my watch in the room! A member of the reception staff ran upstairs, and my watch was found - i was so relieved. Thank you Doubletree Westminster for giving",50,October 2020

The hotel is lovely and brilliant location. We will be back! Thank you! ",50,November 2020
DoubleTree by Hilton London - Westminster,Renovations spoiled the visit - avoid!,"Had I been made aware of the extent of the renovations, I would have booked The Conrad. Not much more expensive but a world of difference! Unfortunately I chose this hotel for the position near the Thames. The photos on the website should reflect what is happening at the hotel. I feel that since I also telephoned them to arrange a late departure for what was a 'special' visit, I should have been informed at the time, that it could be necessary due to noise from 9am, to move room! Why not offer a cheap or free upgrade to get you to higher floors? The room was fairly small anyway, I have to say, for a premium room - much bigger ones available elsewhere but sizes not given in their website spec (suppose that should have made me suspicious). The ""continental"" breakfast I was",20,October 2020

Breakfast is superb! Under Tier 3, on the third day of our stay, breakfast is served in room, still in excellent quality. Truly grateful to the lovely staff who has provided great service.  Due to Covid, it’s not necessary to clean room everyday but you can request to refresh certain facilities. Convenient!  We had a pleasant stay and thank you for all the staffs who has kept to maintain excellency in this difficult time. ",50,December 2020
InterContinental London - The O2,Awful customer service,"It was my boyfriend's birthday and I specified on my notes with the hotel that I'd like to ensure there is a note and potentially a complimentary bottle of Prosecco or wine to surprise him upon arrival. Given the fact, this is a 5 star restaurant and we had booked this location to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday - the hotel made absolutely no effort to even acknowledge that it was his birthday. There was nothing in the room that made us feel welcome or appreciated which has been done for us before at previous hotels on previous birthdays. Secondly, the hotel locks the mini fridge in the room even though it's empty. We spent half an hour waiting outside our room whilst an engineer attempted to open an empty fridge so that we could put our own champagne into the fridge. I",10,December 2020

InterContinental London - The O2,Nice stay in difficult times ,"We stayed for two nights whilst in London to hand Christmas gifts over to friends and family in a selection of London parks LOL . My Wife and I love this hotel . I (normally) have to travel a lot and stay in IHG group’s more budget offerings then use points to stay at this hotel as a treat . I have to say it’s one of the few hotels I’d actually stay at for the sake of it rather then needing to. The main plus point is the staff who are lovely and very attentive and accommodating. On this occasion we had a fantastic afternoon tea looked after by Sylvia - the cakes were amazing amazing. We also had dinner in the brasserie and a gentleman who’s name began with C did a great job of looking after us . Yes, there have had to be adjustments due to COVID : no mini bar , spa has to be",50,December 2020
Hilton London Tower Bridge,Excellent oasis in troubled times,Lovely staff through out the hotel particularly at reception and Breakfast.

Hilton London Tower Bridge,"Lovely staff, great location.","Stayed with 9 year old daughter on a whistle stop overnight stay in London. Great location for all the sights we had pre booked ie Tower of London, London Eye ( via rivercruise). Even got in Pudding Lane which was just under 10 mins walk as well as Buckingham Palace via Green Park tube. The walk back from London eye to Hotel was great alongside the Thames, bars, buskers and a nice feel. The hotel had a trendy boutique deel to it and was smart, immaculately clean and well organized in terms of social distancing/Covid.  The staff made our stay very pleasurable. Prior to our stay i asked for a little suprise for my daughter which i was happy to pay extra for. Lindsay Fernandez went to the trouble to get some luxury chocolates and a hand written card which was left in our room which",50,August 2020
Hilton London Tower Bridge,Catastrophic,Badly managed check-in process. No fresh orange juice. Poor quality magnetic cards. Abuse of the pandemic to justify shameful cost saving measures (they don’t clean the rooms). One of the worst hotels I’ve been in.,10,December 2020
Hilton London Tower Bridge,Very enjoyable stay....,Enjoyed our stay at tower bridge hilton..staff were very good and couldnt do enough for us....particularly a young lady called Arianna.....hotel was in a very good location walking distance from london bridge station and borough market..and close to tower bridge with its many restaurants and wine bars...,40,October 2020
Hilton London Tower Bridge,Fabulous stay,We had a great 4 night stay here - 2 rooms. The cleaning measures are perfect. The staff friendly and helpful at breakfast and dinner and cocktails were great too (and dinner v reasonable). This is a brilliant hotel (especially just now if you want to avoid public transport) as we walked nearly everywhere. Lots of great restaurants nearby as well as takeaways. I have stayed before with work but not with the family. I think it will be my preference for work as well when things are back to normal. ,50,October 2020
Apex City of London Hotel,Wonderful Stay,"Lovely hotel within 5mins walk of Tower Hill underground.

Apex City of London Hotel,Wonderful birthday away,"My boyfriend and me stayed at this hotel for our birthday celebration, 4 nights stay. We were welcomed by a lovely Receptionist I think his name was Alex ? Im not sure, but he was very polite and informative. We were given a complimentary upgrade and headed to our room. The room was very clean, smelled lovely and we were given chocolates and macaroons as a birthday treat. The bed was massive and swans made out of the towels were the spot on. Complimentary tea and coffee and water was such a nice touch. We were located on the 2nd floor and location was perfect, less than 5 minutes away from Tower Hill tube and few good restaurants around the corner like All Bar One etc. Location is a spot on, we decided to go for a walk at night and wow, it was great view of Tower Bridge, Tower",50,October 2020

Premier Inn London Waterloo (Westminster Bridge) Hotel Hotel,Had to share room with strangers pretty much ,"So, my 8 year old daughter and I booked a stay with our friends (also mum with 8 year old)....booked 2 rooms together. You would have thought they would have put us in rooms next door if possible but unfortunately not. My daughter and I spent 2 nights with an interconnecting door to complete strangers! We heard every single word of every single phone call til 2am each night and heard all their conversations as if in same room. Hotel useless when we voiced our concerns....and since when complaining. It appears the Premier Inn no longer have the ‘good night sleep’ guarantee and I was told “thanks for your feedback”.  Our room had no day light as they had painted the window black as was our friends room, you couldn’t see out the windows. I would discourage anyone staying in this",10,October 2020
Premier Inn London Waterloo (Westminster Bridge) Hotel Hotel,Great stay post Lockdown closure,"We booked here after a appointment access the city would make it to late to return home so choose here as had a trip booked the next day on the thames rockets.  I believe hotels first night of opening and I was very impressed with the procedures out in place for Covid.  Had previously stayed in premier inn post Lockdown beginning of july so kinda knew how it all worked.  Staff were very friendly and welcoming, room super clean, any extras bought to the room.  Breakfast has to b booked at a particular time to stagger the guests, now this didn't go quite so smoothly but the staff obviously trying their best in unknown circumstances.  Ideal location for Embankment- London eye, Thames rockets, river cruises, the London dungeon, sea life centre, county hall and more as just literally",50,July 2020
Premier Inn London Waterloo (Westminster Bridge) Hotel Hotel,PINK CARD,"The hotel was clean and tidy, the front of the building had a scaffold erected, but the works ongoing did not impact on our stay.  The staff were polite and willing to help. Things were a little different due to C19 restrictions, measures were put in place to ensure safe dining. Masks were worn by staff, and mandatory for guests in communal areas.  Overall another good stay at a Premier Inn.",50,October 2020
Premier Inn London Waterloo (Westminster Bridge) Hotel Hotel,Interesting old building ...,"Check-in was smooth, despite the obvious limitations masks place on conversation. Covid security is good. Our room was small and dark but I understand this is an old building. Wi-fi kept dropping out which was a pain. Take a look around the hotel corridors if you get a chance as they tell the fascinating history of the building.  Breakfast is on a ""serve you"" basis, where the friendly servers get you exactly what you want. It's a cut down menu but the usual PI stuff.   We got the room at a good price and I appreciate it's a difficult time for businesses like PI so I'm pleased to support their continued struggle to stay open and provide a service for London visitors.",30,October 2020

Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego,Luxury 5 star service,"If you are visiting San Diego, this is the place to be. The hotel has a above 5 star feel to it and the associates really do go above and beyond to make your stay a pleasant one. The front desk associates- Troy and Cruz are above amazing and very well trained on how to welcome guests and make their stay very comfortable. They also have a quieter adult pool that is great if you want the quieter swimming experience, or the louder family pool if you prefer that. And also the Market One food outlet is great, they even have Starbucks coffee and the associates there, are always pleasant and welcoming. The rooms are gorgeous and give you a great overview of the city. I always stay here and would never stay anywhere else while in San Diego. ",50,September 2020
Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego,Great for business travelers,"The hotel is located close to some of the major attractions of San Diego, and is easily accessible both by car and by public transportation. I took a regular room, and it was very good: definitely not for honeymoon type of travel, but very good for attending conventions and conferences at the hotel itself or in the area around it. Breakfast was not included in my rate, however the hotel's restaurant does offer exquisute breakfast options for extra charge. I had been expecting a little more from the bar on of the top floors, however it may simply be that I am too picky in this respect. Overall, the hotel is a great choice for business travel purposes.",50,April 2020
Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego,Beautiful,"The experience was super cool it's right by everything and the staff was super helpful and approachable. Absolutely loved it.

Travelodge Manchester Central,"Large room, good friendly service.","We had to book something in a hurry in Manchester as we had to get out of Athens in a hurry due to Covid 19 closures as Manchester was the quickest / earliest / cheapest flight out. We wanted something in the budget range and found this after searching TripAdvisor for suggestions. The Travelodge check in was easy. the lady behind the counter was polite and professional   and very helpful. The room was very large. A little sparse in furnishings but was clean, tidy. I have marked the rating down as the bed had two dips in it were people sleep. This makes it hard and a little uncomfortable when trying to sleep/ roll over etc and you keep rolling back into the dip. Other than that, it is in a good location, close to may amenities / shops / restaurants. I would recommend a stay here.",40,March 2020

"Manchester Airport, BW Signature Collection by Best Western",Avoid - Should be demolished,"Stayed at the Hallmark for one night while attending a work Christmas party. Room was dated and tired, in need of full refurbishment, especially the bathroom.   Room had not been vacuumed well, furniture all scuffed and tatty.    I was charged twice for my room, once when booking and then again at checkout. Receptionist was rude, and adamant I had not pre paid. I paid up again as I had no proof with me. On returning home found I had paid twice.  It took numerous phone calls and emails to finally get a refund.   While at the party in one of the function rooms my jacket was removed from their cloak room, I still had the ticket for it.

So we arrive to the restaurant about 10 to 7am to find no breakfast as breakfast starts 8 am. We were really lucky 🍀 that lovely Mel (Melanie) walked the extra mile and fed us, Mel and the chef that morning went so far to make us bacon butty, we were so nicely surprised that they made an effort when the breakfast wasn’t due for another hour.

"Manchester Airport, BW Signature Collection by Best Western",Park and Fly,Stayed here on 15/03/20 after a return flight from Egypt. Had previously dropped car off here on 8/03/20 as parking was included in price. Quick and efficient service from reception desk when car dropped off and taxi organised to Airport. They also explained what to do on our return to get taxi to take us back to hotel. Taxi too and from airport was also included in price. Rooms clean and comfortable with tea and coffee making facilities and free WiFi. Breakfast was also good value for money. Wouldn't hesitate to use this hotel again when flying from Manchester Airport. ,50,March 2020
"Manchester Airport, BW Signature Collection by Best Western",Very convenient for Manchester airport,"Stayed here for one night before our flight home, the hotel was less than 10 minutes drive from the rental car return.

Travelodge Manchester Central Arena,No sleep and no help,I had people knocking on my door at night more than once and they walked up and down the corridor until all hours of night near morning keeping my twin babies awake all night trough and when I told the staff they said they been getting a lot of complaints about the same people and they couldn't do anything about it. That is disgraceful and my wife and kids came with me from London for my appointment that I had missed the following morning over being awake all night their was no sign of a night floor staff nothing ,10,November 2020

Travelodge Manchester Central Arena,"Great stay, would recommend!","I stayed here for 2 weeks in September. The staff were fabulous-they were polite, helpful, accommodated my requests (helped me choose a quiet room) and always left me with a smile on my face. The room was clean and looked exactly like the picture. I was on the top floor (quiet floor) and there was very minimum to no noise (I’m quite sensitive to noise) so I could get a really good nights sleep.

Travelodge Manchester Central Arena,Absolutely disposable service,"To be clear. This is not in relation to Travelodge Manchester, it is in relation to Travelodge and their booking service.  I have had multiple transactions go through my account because of Travelodge’s booking system. I’ve been left with multiple bookings which I don’t need and a very unhelpful Lauren in the customer service team has come back and basically said she can’t see any error. I’m waiting over a week between each response. There’s clearly errors!!  Be very careful when booking with Travelodge. Especially if something goes wrong because you’ll have to wait time for a response and then you’ll get somebody like Lauren who clearly can’t be bothered to provide any kind of customer service!!",10,September 2020

Nothing was ever a problem for her and she worked so hard thats why this review is mainly for her as we owe her everything from thw bottom of our hearts we Thank you x,50,October 2020
Airport Inn Manchester,Avoid this place,Despite arriving mid afternoon we were told there was zero availability for any of the pool spa gym facilities. The staff recolied in horror when I told them I'd booked a three course meal for two for the evening! The only starter available was garlic bread and cheese which they managed to burn almost to cremation.The mains were poor quality and small portions. In fairness the young girl tried her best to run the bar and food and gave me a free pint and two teas as she was clearly embarrassed at the fare on offer. The room was cold and had a heavily stained carpet and the walls are paper thin. Overall it's definitely best you look elsewhere to put a smile on your face pre flight.,20,October 2020
Airport Inn Manchester,Just generally poor,"We used the hotel because we had vouchers from a cancelled holiday. Generally very poor,  bed linen was stained, doors didn't work, the bed was tiny,  and tucked away so you had to climb o over your partner to get out. Bathroom had one of those sliding doors with zero privacy.  Go for a Premier Inn anyday.",20,October 2020
Airport Inn Manchester,What Katie did!,"Have stayed here quite a few times over the years mostly as an overnight stop off flying in and out of Manchester. This review is primarily to identify one member of staff who is outstanding! The hotel is pretty low key and unremarkable but Katie the lovely,lovely girl on reception and pretty much everywhere in the hotel! She helped us immeasurably when we had issues regarding our booking ( too long to go into) and sorted everything out upon our return after I could not reach the intended party whilst abroad. Her management should quickly realise the asset they have and reward her as she is an absolute legend and we will return to the hotel on that basis.!!! Many many thanks! Xx",50,August 2020
Airport Inn Manchester,Very poorly managed hotel,"I am very familiar with the Britannia Airport Inn Manchester, as I have been a member of the gym there since 1988. Now that hotels and gyms are finally reopening after the long Coronavirus lockdown, I for one will NOT be renewing my membership to the hotel gym (Spindles). Despite making lots of friends during my time there, I have finally used the forced break to pluck up the courage to finally leave the club. I have simply come to the end of my tether there with regards to the total lack of respect the hotel management (who also manage the gym) have towards their clients. They literally do not give the slightest toss about their customers at all. To write a proper synopsis of the issues I’ve had with the club over the years (Britannia have owned this hotel since January 2014)",10,March 2020

Roomzzz Aparthotel Manchester City,Where better to stay?,"Parking was Q-Piazza, which was very difficult to find. If you drive down Princess Street, then look out for St James Street to the right hand side, it's down there. Two nights will cost you the best part of £40. However, it feels very secure and it's really close to the hotel. Oh, the £40 includes the 25% discount that Roomzzz gives. Get the ticket, because that's the way you can access the car-park and upon checkout, ask the Roomzzz people for a discount voucher, which you feed into the machine first.   So, that's parking.   The hotel itself, I love the look of it. The hotel people are very friendly, helpful and it's just really quick to check-in. A bit strange to get the lift from outside to reception and then another lift to the room.   The room itself (406) was amazing. The",50,September 2020
Roomzzz Aparthotel Manchester City,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in,"This overnight visit to family in Manchester was turned into such a special occasion by choosing this apart-hotel. The location is right in the heart of Manchester’s shopping and dining area  - you can see Selfridges and Next (50 yards away) from the window in our room. The rooms are fully  equipped  to a very high standard with every necessity and the building Itself is beautiful. The staff were professional and efficient at all times. Elizabeth in particular was so nice and, when we had a small problem with our electrics, offered to upgrade us to a suite with any hesitation.

Hilton Manchester Deansgate,Stunning city views,"Artemis and the gang were very attentive. If driving you can use the underground car park (£25). Stunning views of Manchester and beyond. You’ll appreciate this hotel even more the higher the floor you book. Lovely hotel, lovely room... a great time was had. 5 stars",50,October 2020
ibis Manchester Centre 96 Portland Street (new ibis rooms) Hotel,"Adequate, unexciting","One-night stay for a concert in nearby Bridgewater Hall. Very casual welcome, room OK, plenty of space but carpets looked as though they could have done with a deep clean or replacement. Pricey breakfast, which had to be taken at an alternative hotel. OK for a one-nighter, but would hesitate to stay longer or with a partner here.",30,March 2020
ibis Manchester Centre 96 Portland Street (new ibis rooms) Hotel,No Sleep Whatsoever,"I booked this for one night and chose it due to its location to the metro I needed for work. I checked in at around 18:00. There was a band setting up in Chill which is part of the hotel. I was told I was given a quiet room. My room 106 was next to the toilets used for the ""chill bar"", and also the door to enter the corridor. The band started, which I could tolerate. What I couldn't deal with, was the shouting, screaming and door slamming by the other guests who appeared to be there to hear the band. This continued all night, until  22:30 I had had enough. I went to reception to find another guest there complaining. Obviously the noise was on and off all night, the door to the corridor slamming. All in all, I didn't feel as though I had slept much, and certainly had not been",10,March 2020
ibis Manchester Centre 96 Portland Street (new ibis rooms) Hotel,"Great location, awful food","The hotel itself was great value, very good location, spotlessly clean and  walking distance to main sights. Breakfast was nearly £10, cold bacon, sausage and egg in a box like McDonalds only stone cold. Dried up watermelon was the only fruit, just a few boxes of basic cereal. Coffee also cold. I don't normally complain but refused to pay for this rubbish. Next day went next door to Premier In  and for the same price had a lovely buffet breakfast",30,February 2020

ibis Manchester Centre 96 Portland Street (new ibis rooms) Hotel,Now our go-to spot in Manchester!,"We have stayed here a number of times when attending gigs or nights out in Manchester and it is a great hotel. Check in is easy- they don't even have a desk, its all done on a phone! And the rooms are modern- the bathroom is plastic!  We find the location of this hotel most appealing as it is in walking distance to pretty much everywhere.",50,February 2020
Malmaison Manchester,Short stay,"We booked a Saturday night in August. The staff were friendly and we felt welcomed. The Room was cosy and clean with a busy city view. We had a great evening meal in the hotel restaurant, tasty dishes and good service.   There was an incident in the night with a fight in the next room and the police were called, so we did not have a good night’s sleep. However, we will consider to go back again in the future as the hotel staff handled disruption very professional next morning.",40,August 2020
Malmaison Manchester,Really nice hotel,Stayed here on business.... odd atmosphere given how quiet the hotel was... felt like I was only one there.... clearly not the hotels fault... just another impact from COVID.  But hotel upgraded me to a great room.... not sure why more hotels don’t do this as it’s a great way of promoting the hotel for the future.   Receptionist was great and really friendly... and a credit to malmaison.  Will always stay there when I say in Leeds ,50,November 2020
Malmaison Manchester,Very comfortable beds,Stayed at this place while visiting a student at Manchester uni before lockdown.  She was so happy to get a good night's sleep for a change.  It was raining so we mostly lived on room service and everything was perfect.,40,January 2020
Malmaison Manchester,Should have been better,"A number of issues with the room which you would not be expect from a 4* - AC not working making the room stifling, bin not emptied even though it was full, no glasses to enjoy a night cap, toilet roll rationing in effect, and only 1 bed side cabinet.  Breakfast was OK, but there was an additional charge for a full English - not clear/obvious when booking B&B.  Overall, a tad disappointing.",20,November 2020
Malmaison Manchester,Colourful,"Wonderfully decorative and well designed, unfortunately this does not aid In a good nights sleep, and the busy city easily carries through the thin windows. Dinner was something of a shambles though breakfast was fine.",30,October 2020

The Manchester View,First timers at Manchester View,"Enjoyed a 3-day weekend in the Pearl Buck suite. The suite was spacious, clean, quiet, and in good condition overall, except for one of the window locks.  The king bed was comfortable. No safety concerns re Covid. Enjoyed the gas fireplace. The breakfast was basic yet appreciated. Nice & helpful staff. The hiking trails at Equinox Preservation & Pond were great.  High grades for: Ye Old Tavern (dinner) Mystic Cafe & Wine Bar (lunch). Rooster Cafe (lunch) Above All Vermont store Manchester Woodcraft Dorset Farmers Market  ",40,October 2020
The Manchester View,Lovely,"The room was immaculate and spacious, the staff was super friendly, the cleaning crew diligent, HUGE bathroom and shower, Jacuzzi tub (nice bonus)  very comfy bed, gas fireplace and private deck -  all were much better in person than the photos online. We found a ""Happy Anniversary"" note and box of chocolates left in the room for us - which was a very thoughtful touch.  The views of the fall foliage from our deck and windows were gorgeous and the town and area offer a lot to do even during a pandemic. My husband and I were only in town for 2 days to celebrate our 3rd Anniversary - but will certainly return to the Manchester View the next time we visit Vermont.",50,October 2020
Mercure Manchester Piccadilly Hotel,Accommodating Staff,"I am new in the city and fresh in the UK, Anxiety and fear of being a solo traveler is something that can be experienced by anyone whatever opportunity that bring theme here. That feeling was completely gone when I went to reception and met Dan, the staff behind the desk at that point in time. He is hospitable in all aspects . He was catering to another guest when I arrived, solved her room key problems and immediately attend to my needs with 100% kindness. Surely this is a trip I will never forget! #CongratulationsMercure for having reliable staffs!",50,March 2021
Mercure Manchester Piccadilly Hotel,Rough around the edges but excellent customer service,"The Mercure Manchester Piccadilly might be a little rough around the edges in terms of decor and furnishings however you will not find a finer hotel for the hospitality that you will receive.  All of the staff that I interacted with from reception to housekeeping were exceptionally friendly, professional and efficient, nothing was too much trouble and all aimed to ensure that your stay was exceptional; going that extra mile without question.  The hotel requires a little TLC, some of the furnishings and decor are a little dated yet functional. The outside needs a very good clean.  The bed was extremely comfortable and was complimented with superb pillows and duvet which were encased in nice crisp white linen.  The hotel was clean and tidy; the Covid 19 protocols and protection in",50,February 2021
Mercure Manchester Piccadilly Hotel,Amazing customer service,Perfect location & amazing customer service. I always stay at The Mercure when working in Manchester. Dan recognised me straight away when he saw me checked in and even asked if I was happy with my last stay :) Got lucky to be 'Guest of the day' and the room was fantastic. Will definitely recommend the hotel to friends and family.,50,February 2021
Mercure Manchester Piccadilly Hotel,Nhs worker,I’m a doctor and my work requires me to travel. Dani and Sam were absolutely phenomenal. They made me feel welcome and I was also the guest of the day although more like for 2 days. I stayed for two nights and I felt as though it was home from home. They were kind enough to give me complimentary parking as it is £20 a day. But those two guys very welcoming and extremely frindelh. Highly recommend they’ll make you feel like family,50,January 2021
Mercure Manchester Piccadilly Hotel,Great experience at these difficult times,I had to travel in Manchester and stay there overnight for business reasons. I had an excellent experience and Sam from the reception team made me feel welcomed and provided all necessary information required to know during my stay.  I was the lucky guest of the day and got upgraded to a suite room which was the best part of my work trip!   Highly recommended hotel and fantastic staff experience.,50,January 2021
Premier Inn Manchester City Centre (Arena/Printworks) Hotel,"Great hotel, great rates.","I’ll be honest it doesn’t look the most inviting from the outside, but as soon once inside it’s actually abit more modern looking than a lot of the premier inns I’ve stayed in.   The receptionist was lovely, really warm and welcoming,  We did have an issue with very loud noise above us, banging and screaming ( room with 4/5 children in, can’t be helped). We asked to move, no problem at all, changed the room straightaway, again brilliant staff.  The room was really large, clean, and comfortable and good nights sleep.  For the price and location would recommend to anyone, we will definitely stay again.",50,October 2020
Premier Inn Manchester City Centre (Arena/Printworks) Hotel,Great base for Manchester shopping,Stayed in this hotel previously - with lacklustre service but this time totally different. Went for a post-Covid shop in Manchester with 16 yr old grandaughter.  Arrived at 10.30 and was met by very pleasant and efficient young man who said our room was ready immediately which was great to drop cases and head out in the pouring rain. However although I had booked a twin room on line we had been given a double. No-one on Reception as we headed out so on our return around 4 we informed same young man of problem and he immediately gave us another room (easier I suppose with a half empty hotel). Room extremely spacious so plenty room to put shopping! Updated room was clean and bathroom immaculate. On 7th floor so good view of the canal despite the torrential rain. This hotel ideal,50,August 2020
Premier Inn Manchester City Centre (Arena/Printworks) Hotel,Comfy spacious room,"We booked one night at this hotel as a little night away and couldn’t fault the room and the service that reception and breakfast staff gave us. We were unfortunate enough to have our rear window smashed and the car broken into whilst it was parked in the hotel car park. This obviously put a dampener on our night away, however could not fault the staff at the hotel. Very understanding and sympathetic and provided us with a tea and coffee and a place to sit to sort out insurance etc. Would especially like to thank Ryan at reception for helping us to clear out some of the glass from the car even when it was pouring with rain.",40,October 2020
Premier Inn Manchester City Centre (Arena/Printworks) Hotel,Great stay,"Visited for two nights recently and was really impressed. Great location for city centre with less than a 10 minute walk meaning you don't need to worry about getting taxis.  We found the room very spacious with everything that was needed and that you'd expect. Additional pillows, towels and bedding etc was available on request as was an iron and the staff were more than happy to supply things as necessary. There wasn't a phone in the room meaning we had to go down to reception to request additional items which although not a huge issue would have made more sense to have a phone in the room especially when they advertise the front desk number in the room.  We had breakfast both mornings and again were very satisfied with this. Very reasonably priced and includes everything you",50,September 2020
Premier Inn Manchester City Centre (Arena/Printworks) Hotel,Pleasant Stay,First time staying here and was pleasantly surprised location is right next to Arndale Shopping centre we had 2 rooms as thought 1 might be a bit cramped for family of 4 so we got a family room and double room the family room was very spacious and would have fitted 4 of us no problem. Receptionist at check in check out very pleasant restaurant only open for breakfast it was all you can eat but still only table service bar was closed. Overall a great hotel we will return when things settle down again,50,September 2020
Premier Inn Manchester City (Piccadilly) hotel,Excellent Customer Serrvice,"The Premier Inn Manchester Piccadilly stands out from the crowd in this hotel brand thanks to its superb employees. In welcoming me to the hotel and dealing with some issues the staff went the extra mile to assist me, doing this in a friendly and professional manner, making me feel valued as a customer and not just another booking reference number which is the case at some of the other Premier Inn in the UK.  Location is very good for Manchester Piccadilly Mainline Train Station together with all the amenities that Manchester City Centre has to offer include on the doorstep the trendy Northern Quarter.  The rooms are standard Premier Inn, exceptionally clean and in good decorative order (the corridor could do with a lick of paint). The television was new and the ultimate Wi-Fi",40,March 2021
Premier Inn Manchester City (Piccadilly) hotel,Super hotel,"This is a great hotel, clean, quiet (even with all the building work going on outside) and a great location. I chose one of the premier plus rooms this time and was not disappointed, it was a delight to stay in and such value for money. The staff are lovely, really pleasant and always helpful. The new breakfast arrangements were done really well with table service and screens between tables. Hand sanitisers everywhere, it was a pleasure to stay and felt very safe in these strange times. I can't rate this hotel and it's staff high enough and am looking forward to staying here again very soon.",50,September 2020
Premier Inn Manchester City (Piccadilly) hotel,"Nice staff ,bit dated and not the cleanest",Staff very friendly and welcoming despite current situation  Stayed in many premier inns and this just seemed a bit dated in need of a refurb lots of scuffs on walls etc  Bathroom had black mould in areas apart from that handy location,30,February 2021
Premier Inn Manchester City (Piccadilly) hotel,Outstanding Customer Service,"The hotel is in a very handy location, approximately 5 minutes walk from Piccadilly station. The room was extremely clean. By far the most notable quality of the hotel is the accommodating quality of the staff; they were beyond helpful. One member of the reception team was particularly helpful during my stay when I had to return home early due to lockdown. I believe she was just about to retire soon after my stay approximately 6 weeks ago and her name was Brenda. An overall great experience!",50,November 2020
Premier Inn Manchester City (Piccadilly) hotel,Decent location but not much to the rooms,"I was staying there 3 nights on a business trip.  The hotel was in an ideal location (close to the station and to town) which was ideal. The reception staff was welcoming. The rooms were basic, beds were confortable, but they lacked anything to stand out. This hotel is ideal if you are only in the room to sleep, because there wifi is awful. And im sorry I am not going to pay 5 pounds a day for premium Wifi, its 2020 people, wifi should be fast and free in any hotel.   Overall, good sleep, but if you plan on spending a lot of time in the hotel room i would look somewhere else.",30,December 2020
INNSIDE Manchester,Nice Location and Pleasant Staff,"The location has been perfect for my stay in Manchester, Very safe and COVID secure. My room had a really nice view. The staff were brilliant.

INNSIDE Manchester,Perfect Location,"This is the first time that we have stayed at a different hotel when visiting Manchester and I have to say you won’t be disappointed if you stay here.   We paid a little extra for a city view room and it was worth it. The view was amazing.   The hotel room was large and very modern with a walk in rain shower which certainly woke you up in the morning.   The hotel is in a prime location for the bars and restaurants on First Street and the hotel is only a short walk from Oxford Road and Deansgate stations.   The staff were very welcoming and friendly even in these troubling times. They could not do enough to make sure the guests stayed safe.   Everything in the room was wrapped in plastic after it had been disinfected, the cleaners had done a fantastic job.   The bed was very",50,October 2020

INNSIDE Manchester,Overall very good,Overall we had a lovely stay. Was during covid and the area was in tier 3 so not many things going on. But that's how we like it to be honest.  Place was very clean and the staff friendly and helpful.  Only issue was exposure of bath to the room. The screen only covered half of the bath and the exposed area faced directly into the room by the bed. Could very easily get water everywhere.,40,December 2020

Crowne Plaza Manchester City Centre,No complaints,"First time staying at the crowne plaza Manchester and was very impressed. Check in was quick and easy and the woman on the desk (I forget her name) was very friendly and helpful.  Upon checking in, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I'd been given a complimentary room upgrade from a queen room to a junior suite. This was probably due to the fact that they were at low capacity due to the covid nonsense, but a nice gesture nonetheless. My room (701) was spacious, clean and modern. All in all I had a very good stay and thanks for the complimentary late checkout!  Hopefully be back soon.",50,November 2020
Crowne Plaza Manchester City Centre,Sports Event,"I don't think I even have the words to tell how exceptional this group is. I would recommend Crowne Plaza Manchester City Centre to anyone who goes to the city. We organised one of our biggest events there and it was a pleasure to work with these guys. From day one when I met Bob he made me feel at ease that everything will go to plan. As you know when you plan a live event nothing ever goes to plan but this team somehow resolved everything magically. Balazs, Joana, Kim, Bob, the ladies who served our breakfast, reception team, EVERYONE was exceptionally helpful, hospitable, positive, welcoming, smiley and polite! Thank you guys Evi Mylona",50,September 2020
Crowne Plaza Manchester City Centre,Extremely disappointed,"I have a huge complaint to make. I need an email address or contact number where someone actually picks up so I can put forward my complaint.   Very briefly, I’ve been double charged and was given incorrect information by the hotel staff. It was my first time staying at a Crowne Plaza and the staff wasn’t helpful!!! I want a full refund for a stay that didn’t even take place!!!  Absolutely disappointed and frustrated with the service I’ve received.",10,November 2020
Crowne Plaza Manchester City Centre,First time in a Crowne Plaza - very good stay,"This was our first time in a Crowne Plaza hotel, and tried it instead of our usual Manchester choice to try something different.  We stayed as a family of three on a Thursday evening in a double double room with two double beds, breakfast and local parking included in the rate, booking direct with the hotel on their website for £75 - very reasonable   The hotel is in a prime location, minutes walk from both the print works and the arndale. There’s a spar shop a minutes walk away too for anything you need.   Reception staff were particularly pleasant with a fast check in, we were in our room within a few minutes.

Manchester Marriott Victoria & Albert Hotel,Amazing stay,My partner and I stayed here in September 2020. The world was in tier 3 so not much of the Manchester east in teir 3 which was an absolute shame as it's new refurbished bar looked amazing.  We were lucky enough to be put into a brand new room which noone had stayed in. It was beautiful.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  It was spotless clean and it had the most amazing shower.  I cant praise this hotel and its staff enough. We cant wait to get back when its fully opened to enjoy all of its facilities. If you're  a Manchester United fan you will definitely enjoy this hotel with its tribute to United in the reception area and its united themed suites .,50,September 2020
Manchester Marriott Victoria & Albert Hotel,Very Honest Review,"I booked this hotel as a little escapism in these troubling times and had a very mixed experience here, so thought I would share both the positives and negatives.   Firstly, the hotel is gorgeous, lovely place to be and really close to Spinningfields/Deansgate so great location if you're heading out for the evening. Every single member of staff I came across was absolutely wonderful, and a special thank you to the lovely lady who upgraded me on check in, a really nice touch.  Unfortunately my issues lie with the room itself. Basic things really that weren't functional, such as the shower was not warm at all (very tepid temperature) even on the hottest setting, and TV was terrible. Not compatible with fire sticks etc and there was no option to hire films, which really was a shame",30,October 2020
Manchester Marriott Victoria & Albert Hotel,Lovely hotel,"We had a one night stay at this hotel during the pandemic. The staff were very friendly and helpful in keeping everyone safe.

ABode Manchester,Great hotel!,"We were a bit worried about travelling in these times but took the plunge. So glad we did as this hotel is one of the nicest we’ve stayed in.  Check in was swift and easy. Giles took my temperature. I was a bit concerned as I’m menopausal, but it was fine. Our room (Angel Suite) was beautiful and with a hint of being gothic. The bed was so large and comfy. It had everything we needed.  Breakfast was in the form of a hamper with bread, cheese, cereal, fruit, tea and coffee and more..... but I did miss a bacon butty. I’m sure when the time is right, the hotel will reintroduce hot food. We were aware before we arrived that there would be no restaurant or bar. This was a shame, but didn’t ruin the break. It would have been nice to have a cocktail or two or some nibbles. But we just",50,October 2020

Clayton Hotel Manchester Airport,FIRST RATE,"I can't speak more highly of this hotel. The staff are a great team who work hard to achieve a high level of welcome and support.  We booked a Stay and Park package, which was competitively priced. The room was clean and comfortable - and a little larger than some other rival hotels. The food was well prepared both in the lounge and at breakfast. Thanks to all - the cheerful reception staff, the accommodating F and B waiters, the keen to help bus drivers and a big cheer for the guy who managed to get my car going again after being parked five weeks in a wintry car park.

The car park although it needs a good sweep, is a good facility on site for £5. Everything in the room was clean and tidy. The housekeeper did leave a cleaning cloth on the sofa.

DoubleTree by Hilton Manchester Piccadilly,Great hotel and very good Covid safety,"I stayed here twice, once for two nights and then again for one night. The digital key is great. Loved choosing my room and going straight to the room. You have to remember to collect your free drinks vouchers if you’re a Diamond member, I don’t understand why they cannot be placed in the room.  The distancing procedures are great and at night I saw they had a security guard insisting everyone in the public areas wore a mask.  The room was very clean and I noticed a lot of stuff that is normally there like the kettle and cups and glasses were removed, not sure why since surely they can be sterilized?

DoubleTree by Hilton Manchester Piccadilly,"Very clean, superb breakfast. Not valued as Honors guest","The room was okay, but a little cold despite the heating being on full all night. The heating didn’t heat the bathroom which meant is was very chilly.  However, the room was very clean, and relatively comfortable.  The breakfast was outstanding. It was hot, arrived at exactly the time for which I ordered it, and was very tasty. Superb offering during Covid - I was very impressed with this aspect.   Overall I didn’t feel particularly valued as a Hilton Honors Diamond guest - despite there being a better room available I wasn’t given this on check-in, and I did ask. This was resolved the next morning and I accepted a goodwill gesture, but I wanted an upgraded room rather than any gesture post-event.

Macdonald Manchester Hotel,Always stay here when coming to Manchester - have done for years and still great,"We’ve been coming here for years and years and never had a ‘bad’ experience - a few issues along the way but where been a fair few times.   Every room has a large bath, filling in a few minutes with a separate shower which again is a huge walk in type and very powerful. Beds are king size and very comfortable, with plenty of pillows. There’s a flat screen tv, these are quite small for the room size but generally acceptable. Fixtures and fittings are getting slightly dated but we’ve not had a room yet where anything was in dire need or broken and never had to complain. Large panoramic windows throughout and full length blackout curtains complete all rooms.   Regarding parking, it’s a complete rip off at £25 a night, that’s almost half of the cost of a standard king room on",50,October 2020

Obviously with the pandemic I had to reschedule. I was told I can change the date of my booking until December 2020 as the room was non refundable. I then moved the date to next weekend but I am unable to go as my area is under local lockdown. Even though they initially said I could keep moving the date to suit, The hotel is now refusing to let me move the date of my booking, even though they know I can’t go and stay there without breaking the lockdown restrictions.

Hotel popular with stag / hen parties or people on binge drinking weekends.   Hotel outdated, could do with a makeover. Windows dated and very drafty, could hear everything outside.  Looked at eating in the hotel but the pizza place had a musty off smell. Didn’t even hang around to see if it was open.  Not worth the money. ",20,August 2020

Travelodge Manchester Piccadilly Hotel,Hotel from Hell,"Ok, it wasn’t as bad as the title suggests, but when we stayed on one of the hottest days of the year, last August, it certainly felt like we were in the fiery pits of Hell.  The location is good for the train station, but do be aware that the area just opposite felt very unsafe during the evening with dodgy looking people hanging around. It’s also pretty well known for not being the safest area, I discovered after googling it during our stay.   Now the actual hotel. First impressions were good. The staff were lovely and the decor was fine. Check in went smoothly but then we hit our first spot of trouble, the key wouldn’t open the door to the corridor.

Takes about 5/10 minutes to walk to the hotel, which in turn is around a 10 minute walk from most bars/pubs/clubs so was perfect for us as we were out and about most of the time. Across the road were several chain restaurants, there was a mini fast food market within 20 seconds walk too which was all good. The hotel was clean, clear signs for social distancing/mask wearing.

Premier Inn Manchester Airport (M56/J6) Runger Lane South,Dreadful place,"I had an awful time at this hotel from start to finish. It was almost empty and I can, having stayed there, see why. The staff weren't at all friendly, there was absolutely no effort on their part to make me feel welcome and it was like they had decided to be as awkward and unhelpful as possible. Whilst the breakfast was good, the service wasn't. Apparently there's a notice in the rooms telling guests that rooms aren't cleaned during stays of over 1 night - like who actually reads notices in a hotel? It seems like it was an excuse NOT to clean the room and let's blame Covid for everything",10,September 2020

The hotel was easy to get to with plenty of onsite parking, good breakfast (to be eaten in your room due to all the Covid rules). The hotel is across the road from the skywalk to Terminal 1. (Actually that is the only downside, that you have to cross the (usually) very busy road but luckily at that time in the morning it was not busy at all, nor it was raining, so walking was fine with us).  Normally,  they operate a shuttle bus but due to Covid-19, there wasn't one available so your best option is to walk, though tricky if you have heavy bags or it's raining.

The hotel, which there is 2 opposite each other (make sure you go to the right one 🤦‍♂️) its very new looking and what you expect from a premier inn.  Rooms are big, comfy and clean but what made this hotel was the two reception staff on my arrival who where very welcoming and more than happy to advise where to eat locally and who delivered etc.  I can imagine when the airport is open this can be a busy hotel and prices will probably be way more than the £28pn I paid ",40,January 2021

Premier Inn Manchester Airport (M56/J6) Runger Lane North,Shameful,Arrived & was greeted upon a rude young lady.  Hotel did not notify us that the restaurant was not open for dinner & lunch when booking.  The evening staff (Miguel) was fantastic. Such a shame that it was let down by the following points. Told no late check out because cleaners need to give COVID time to calm down in the room. Ridiculous! Told we could not sit in the cafe area inside the hotel to await our taxi so have to stand outside in the cold for over 90 mins.  3 female Staff sat on reception without masks.  When stood near said staff they changed language from English to Russian & laughed & joked making us uncomfortable.  Disgraceful attitude from one particular young Russian woman.

We weren't let down. In a nutshell a stay at The Resident will be just as it always was. Of course there are some slight changes and additional rules and regulations but they will be explained simply and clearly and with calm reassurance.

As well as late check out and early check in and a free upgrade if available. As a wheelchair-user the staff could not have been more accommodating of my additional needs and the response to any email queries is super speedy.  All of the above is true, but the thing that really makes The Resident (formally the Nadler) special is its staff. They were warm and inviting and went",50,December 2020

Premier Inn Liverpool City Centre (Liverpool One) Hotel,Two Night Visit ,A great two night stay at the Premier Inn (Liverpool One).   A really warm welcome from David and he and Jose could not have been more helpful and pleasant throughout our stay there.   Nothing was ever too much trouble.   Spotlessly clean and rooms very spacious and comfortable.  Breakfast is up to the expected Premier Inn standard and again nothing too much trouble -  excellent table service.  Hotel is right at Liverpool One shopping area - very convenient.  Feels very safe with only residents of the hotel admitted unless allowed in - and lifts and rooms will onlh work in conjunction with the room key.  Would definitely visit again and would highly recommend.  Thank you - especially to David and Jose!!!!!  ,50,October 2020
Premier Inn Liverpool City Centre (Liverpool One) Hotel,Easy stay,"Only a few minutes' taxi ride from Lime Street Station, the hotel is really conveniently located. The check in experience was smooth (although we had some issues trying to get the main doors to open!), the room was spotlessly clean and the price for the location was a real bargain. Highly recommended.",50,October 2020

Hotel Indigo Liverpool,Joke of a management team ,"So we checked into the hotel on 28th December under Tier 2 restrictions. Room was nice enough albeit a little tired , but we were here for 4 nights including NYE . So all good so far , come Thursday 31st at approx 15.00hrs , having been shopping, we were just getting into the lift when reception beckoned us over . Hi guys are you here on business? Errrrr no we’re not . Ok well you’ll have to leave because we’ve now changed Tiers and can’t accept leisure bookings ! Ok so you knew this at midnight yet you’ve waited until you just happened to spot us walking into the hotel at 3pm in the afternoon to tell us we need to vacate the room IMMEDIATELY! So here we are now essentially stranded in Liverpool trying to get back to Carlisle . The duty manager couldn’t have been less interested",10,December 2020
Hotel Indigo Liverpool,Chilled night away!,"We booked a double room, half board. The room was lovely and clean. We went to have our evening meal to be told they were fully booked!! Eventually after a little chat we managed to sit and eat at a reasonable time. This hiccup could have been avoided if we had been informed of the process when booking or in the booking confirmation. We could not fault the food and service, portion sizes excellent! Sadly we were disturbed for the majority of the night by noisy neighbours!!! Sure their was a party going on with 'lots' of people in the room next door!! We didn't starve at breakfast. Full cold and hot breakfast available. We will stay again...hopefully have quieter neighbours!! ",40,December 2020
Hotel Indigo Liverpool,Fantastic Weekend away,"I would highly recommend the Hotel Indigo. Absolutley spotless, bed so comfy,big fluffy white towels, dressing gowns and slippers also provided. Close to the centre for shopping. Discounted car parking. Staff couldn't do enough for you. I would just like to mention Julie who served us at Breakfast both days. We have never been to Liverpool before and Julie was so helpful as to what was around and where to go, Julie was so attentive at Breakfast also, we wanted for nothing, the Breakfast was 👌. We would definatley stay at the hotel again if we returned.  Fantastic work ladies and gents, Higly recommend. 5 ⭐ We felt very safe with the current Covid situation.",50,December 2020

Jurys Inn Liverpool,Wonderful business stay!,"I had a really great stay along with several of my colleagues, as part of a business trip attending the ACC conference centre over a year ago.  I was hosting an early morning meeting and due to some last minute changes, I desperately needed somewhere to get some urgent printing done. Erika Gallagher could not have been more helpful, and saved me a huge amount of time with her support from the front desk - she really did save the day and saved me a huge amount of stress in the process. I only wish I'd remembered to leave a review earlier!",50,February 2020
Jurys Inn Liverpool,Awful customer service,the front of house staff were extremely rude and unhelpful on arrival. The staff member was obviously not very happy to be there or to be working. I would never recommended to anyone or stay again. Do not recommend,10,December 2020
Jurys Inn Liverpool,Would we book again? Of course we would,"We booked for 1 night stay to visit family. What we want from accommodation, jurys had. Keen price, friendly staff, comfy bed, clean bathroom. Sad, due to the c word, that jurys, in fact everywhere lacked atmosphere as bars, restaurant closed. A good varied selection of pillows  so catered for all requirements. Plenty of tea, coffee and milk portions. Only draw back, you need to use a public carpark, about 5 min walk away, costs about £25 a day.  Did we mind paying £45 for one night accommodation, no, would we visit again, definitely.",50,October 2020
Jurys Inn Liverpool,Decent budget option - maybe not visit again on a stormy night!! ,"Visited Liverpool last minute and booked into the Jury's. The room was £45 for a family room (2 doubles), excellant value. The rooms basic but comfortable and the hotel is right on the docks and 5mins walk to Liverpool One. The staff are friendly. Car park just 1min away for £15/24hrs. The evening we stopped there were 50mph winds and our window was taking a beating(issue with the seal or something??) it sounded like the window was about to cave in at times and sleep was impossible until the early hours when the wind subsided. ",30,November 2020
Jurys Inn Liverpool,Food scam,"Stayed here for work. They charged £150 to my card for drinks ect which they said they would refund at the end. A breakfast and dinner were available for crew which we presumed were free as there was no sign of a price list next to the menu or anywhere and no one at the hotel informed us we would be charged. The food was the worst food I've ever eaten. The vegetarian was chopped tomatoes from a can with something else thrown in each day and there was not a lot of it. At the end of my stay they refunded me £87 of the £150 having changed £63 for my meals, £21 for each meal! I'd expect a fantastic meal for the that cost! Absolute daylight robbery, I felt scammed and the whole thing has ruined my stay. Will not be returning to any jurys Inn. Disgraceful",10,October 2020
Malmaison Liverpool,Toffee shop room,"My partner and I stayed here for his 40th birthday. We had a lovely stay considering the pandemic restrictions! We stayed in the Toffee shop room. It was clean,the bedroom, bathroom and living quarters all fabulous. The rooms are dark but you do get used to it. We quite liked it! Bonus having a TV in the bedroom too. It could do with a slight upgrade (bit of wallpaper coming off here and there) I do feel that 'The Kop' has a better deal having a games football table in but I'd rather stay in the might blues room so can't complain. Evening meal was FANTASTIC! Room service was great. Staff are very welcoming. Would definitely stay again.",40,December 2020
Malmaison Liverpool,Great staff and an amazing and throughly enjoyable perfect stay!!,"We came for Christmas as family and what a Christmas stay and meal we had, made extra delightful by the hospital and chirpy friendly staff who couldn't do enough for us. They looked after us and ran after our 21 month old little boy, no end and we actually felt so rested and catered for. Despite it being Christmas Day and the staff working, they were so friendly and cheerful and couldn't do enough for us, especially Peter, Sara, Recca, Jodie and Phil. Thank you so much to those wonderful staff members who really did make our stay extra lovely. Special thanks to Peter as my 21 month old, after a long exciting day of present opening and festivities, started getting cranky and tired after the meal and Peter gave me great advice and tips from looking after young children in his",50,December 2020
Malmaison Liverpool,Husband’s birthday,My husband was 50 on Boxing Day and I booked an offer with room and meal for the family. We had 2 different tables. The meal was lovely and we got a complimentary bottle of Prosecco as tables were not next to each other as originally expected. However we were out in the private room and the rest of the family were as near as could be. Jordan’s customer service was second to none as were all the other waiting staff. Really impresses by their attitude . Also breakfast was lovely and again the waiting staff were great. Rooms were amazing and looking forward to another break there soon. Thanks for making my day special,50,December 2020
Malmaison Liverpool,Amazing everything,"We always stay at malmasion, can’t fault it at all, staff are sooo nice, views are gorgeous and rooms are lovely. Abbie on check in was lovely she was soo helpful and she made us feel so welcome. Can’t wait to stay again.",50,December 2020
Malmaison Liverpool,Last minute stay,"Really can’t say that this hotel still warrants a four star rating. It’s worn in places and the commode it hasn’t changed much since I last stayed 10 years ago. All in all I was let down with this stay! The first room we had allocated stank of cigarette smoke. Reception moved us to another room which was worn in places ie, work leather on furniture and carpet needed a good going over! Was t impressed at all. Then to ad insult further at breakfast I was finishing my cup of tea and peered in the bottom of the cup to find a ring of tea left from the previous person. The cup obviously hadn’t been washed properly which in the current COVID climate is very concerning! I pointed this out to the waitress who simply replaced my tea with another even though I had finished and didn’t ask",10,December 2020
Crowne Plaza Liverpool City Centre,Cleanest hotel I staid at since pandemic started,"Staid in a few hotels since March as we were unable to have a 'proper' holiday abroad. Out of all, including a few 5*, Crown Plaza was the cleanest and it seems to pay attention to those details that usually get forgotten. We had a room with a waterfront view which was gorgeous. We also used the pool and steam room which were not bad either. The reception staff were lovely and the room service was quick with delicious food. The only thing that would have made our stay better would have been the presence of slippers in the room.. had to use our own shoes to get to the pool but that is just me. I suppose the pice was low due to lack of demand but definitely worth a stay. If ever again in Liverpool this would be my first choice of hotel. Breakfast was ok as well ",50,December 2020
Crowne Plaza Liverpool City Centre,Anniversary stay,There's a reason why this hotel still stands amongst the best in the city.  Its impeccably cleam throughout and covid safe.  The leisure club is spotless and Dawn and fiona where lovely.  The Irish girl on reception was really nice and her customer service skills are excellent.  Fantastic grab and go breakfast.

Mercure Liverpool Atlantic Tower Hotel,Business Course,Great visit.  Staff are all friendly and strive to help you with anything. Stayed 3 nights last week and 3 this week. Let me have same room 2nd time. Back again next week and same room booked. Felt very safe as hotel have lots of covid free measures in place.

Keep up the good work and will be back, in fact hopefully as a regular. ",50,February 2021
Hilton Liverpool City Centre,Great stay,"This hotel is definitely the best Hilton brand in Liverpool. While the room decor is not too outdated, a refurbishment would not hurt (especially in terms of the TVs).  The check-in was outstanding and my Hilton membership was recognised and I have received an upgrade. While the main executive lounge was not in a normal operation, the hotel did provide service for guests with exec lounge access in the evening (free bites & drinks) in a nice, airy area on the first floor.  I can highly recommend this hotel. It’s a definitely better choice than the DoubleTree located in the city centre, especially if you have a Hilton status and if you want a room without a leaking sink and appliances that do not work.",50,December 2020
Hilton Liverpool City Centre,Very disappointed ,I was very disappointed by the room booked a king executive room room was an ok size had a nice view but the windows were so dirty couldn't see it the room was very tired stains on carpets scratched furniture I expected more from the Hilton ,30,December 2020
Hilton Liverpool City Centre,Disappointing beds but clean and central,"We stayed one night and it went well at first. Nice, clean room with a good view. Modern rooms with various amenities including ice machines on every floor. Great location.   Unfortunately when we went to sleep, the mattress itself was very soft and saggy - felt almost like a hammock. The pillows were flat as pancakes. Not the standard you usually get at a Hilton brand.   Service was mixed. The daytime front desk staff seemed harassed by the usual 3pm rush to check in, and seemed a bit offhand. But when a group of guys were partying loudly in a neighbouring room past midnight, the person on the front desk at night was very courteous and dealt with it promptly. ",30,December 2020
Hilton Liverpool City Centre,Nice hotel for a Christmas Break,"This is a great hotel which is situated in a great location. Check in was quick with my digital key and I was in my room in no time. The room was large and had a separate sitting room, which was lovely.  The Exec Lounge was open during the day but only for coffee, the evening alcohol and food service was in the main hotel and you only got 2 vouchers per person and a small food helping. I’m not sure why it could not be served in the Exec Lounge rather than having to try and find space to sit. There was no service at all on Christmas Day because they were serving Christmas Dinner and therefore no space or staff I presume.  Breakfast was good and they took every effort to make sure people were distanced.   Overall, it was a nice Christmas at the Hilton but I’d have preferred to",30,December 2020
Hilton Liverpool City Centre,Awful service and room quality,"We had to change the room as it smelled of cigarette smoke and the tap was too far away from the sink to be able to wash your hands comfortably. In the second room the room service menu and soap dish were missing, the bedsheet was torn, there was fresh red liquid under the glass table top. We tried to pick up the room service menu from the reception as many people were checking in but we were told to go back to our room to check again and call if it wasn’t there. I called and waited for 20 minutes and then called again and was told it will be brought straightaway. After another 15 minutes the reception did not answer the phone so I went downstairs and asked for a manager to whom I explained the situation and who said sorry they were very busy and gave me the menu saying that the",10,December 2020

Very easy and fast process with very welcoming staff.  Thank you to Rayna, Lynsey, Rebecca and Taylon who made our stay.  Room was spotless, spacious with a great ambiance about it. We ate in the bar/restaurant for dinner and breakfast and the food was delicious. We were looked after my Eve, Marian, Tim, Paul and Hicky. Although the hotel was really busy at the time, all staff members are happy and always make an effort to make sure everything is at a top standard. Plenty of covid 19 measures put in place which makes you feel very safe under the current circumstances.   What a beautiful hotel, amazing staff and excellent service. By far one of the best hotels in",50,December 2020
Pullman Liverpool,"Clean, modern and classy","We had a good stay - check in was easy and staff were helpful. The public areas and rooms are smartly decorated and felt modern. We stayed in a superior room with river view, which seemed to have a better view of the city (facing north) than the more expensive room categories facing out to the river. The super king bed was very comfortable. We liked the lighting and the design of the walk in shower/toilet. Great hotel. ",50,October 2020
Pullman Liverpool,Nice Hotel,"This is a modern hotel in a great location for , walks along waterfront, Albert Dock and access into the city for shopping etc. Parking nearby is good but expensive @£18 per 24hours.

The only disappointment was was the restaurant Wheelers by Marco White was closed due to COVID but when I booked online I was encouraged to book restaurant by Accor as if it was still open !!!  We would stay here again in normal times ",40,December 2020
Pullman Liverpool,Post lockdown stay,"This was the second time staying in this hotel, stayed on 8th floor this time. Rooms are really modern and spacious, mini fridge with water provided and we brought some drinks and snacks to store in fridge which came in handy. Television was big and had a good selection of channels which included freeview. I think the lady who checked us in was called Rebecca and she was super helpful, breakfast was included in the stay. Would definitely stay again ",50,December 2020
Pullman Liverpool,The Best Stay Ever,"We stayed here 4 years ago and love it then. This time we are in the grip of a pandemic but it didn’t mar our stay.  The hotel was still as perfect as it was 4 years ago and staff were still as attentive. Best of all was having our breakfast delivered to our room and not having to rush downstairs to eat. It was bliss. We live in Liverpool but for 2 nights we were tourists and loved every minute. For a stress free fabulous stay away, book the Pullman.",50,December 2020

We would like to say thank you to all the Novotel staff for our stay. Would highly recommend to everyone who comes to Liverpool.

Novotel Liverpool Centre Hotel,Covid and accessibility issues,"I’ve stayed here lots over the last 3 year. I booked to double rooms. One for wheelchair use with adapted bathroom, the other for my travelling companion with dogs.  For some reason the hotel had configured my room as twins, 1.5 metres apart. They seem to think I might not need a double bed. They sorted it quickly. However their accessible option is a bath, into which I cannot get. No wet rooms/level access showers. Not good enough.  They’ve got a Covid compliant one way system in and out. But the exit is via the wheelchair access door. Meaning I had to navigate the revolving door. Not easy in a wheelchair.",30,December 2020
Novotel Liverpool Centre Hotel,Great location,"On arrival the reception staff were efficent but not particularly informative, they made us aware of booking a breakfast slot but made no mention of pool, gym or any in room services. Not a problem usually but in the covid era we felt a little left out. The hotel is immaculate and well maintained and we paid extra for the executive room on the top floor which is great if you don't want any noise from hanover street. The room itself was very spacious and i think that's essentially what we were paying extra for as aside from bathrobes and a nespresso machine everything was pretty standard. Slightly weird layout as the toilet was seperate from the bathroom but there was no sink in the toilet and i was surprised to find no bath although the shower was good.   Room amenties were fine",30,December 2020
Novotel Liverpool Centre Hotel,Great stay,"Visited here for a night before 2nd lockdown as the children wanted a night away. Picked the Novotel because it had a pool and gym and was very close to Liverpool 1. We visited the Albert dock and museum first then arrived at the hotel  for 2pm. We all visited the pool and gym which was lovely, the children had a great time. We then stayed in the hotel for our evening meal which was nice. The rooms were pleasant and clean with a fridge in. Breakfast was a little disappointing for £12 but every member of staff we encountered were lovely. On the next day we visited Liverpool 1 then went for a final swim. It was great we didn’t have to check out until 12 as this allowed the time to do things. We would definitely visit here again, especially as the second room we booked was half",50,November 2020
Novotel Liverpool Centre Hotel,A very nice stay but room fairly basic.,"Stayed here a few weeks ago, and got upgraded to an executive room, but it still felt quite basic. It was travelodge esque. Despite the room being basic, we had a very nice stay. The location is ideal for anyone wanting to be close to the restaurants and bars. The breakfast was made to order for hot food, and the cereal and pastries were in a buffet format. The swimming pool was probably the highlight for me, and on that basis I would stay here again, over the Hilton, Pullman etc. Hopefully the rooms may get abit of a make over at some point. The staff were all hard working and answered all are queries. I wish everyone all the best during these problematic times.  ",40,October 2020

Aloft Liverpool,Very unimpressed,We got to the hotel to find that the room we had booked was without heating and electricity and that the room was no longer available for the evening. After travelling 2 hours to get there this was not a good start. Alternatively they offered to move us to another hotel where we would get a king room like we had paid for. We proceeded to do this. The hotel we were transferred to was a good 20 mins away which wasn't ideal given that we had planned the weekend being around Aloft. We had also paid to park in the car park adjacent to Aloft so coming back for this in the morning was another inconvenience. I appreciate that some things are out of Aloft's control however the fact that they gave us such little notice given we had travelled a good distance is quite frankly unacceptable.,10,December 2020

Aloft Liverpool,Ok but wouldn't pay the normal price,We have been looking at staying here for a while and managed to get a weekend for half the price of the normal price. The stay was ok however there are better 4 star hotels in Liverpool and I wouldn't have been happy if I would have paid the normal rate.  The building is beautiful however has been ruined by the modern decor. We did ask for a quiet room however they put us next to  the lift which was very noisy. We had to ask for extra towels as we were only given 1 between us. We were woken up at 9:30 to find out what time we were checking out (checkout is at 12).This was very disappointing because we were baby free for the night for the first time since before the first lockdown and wanted a lie in. I don't think I have ever had anyone come up to the room three and a half hours,20,December 2020

The staff were most welcoming, professional, efficient and friendly with a great attitude which represented in making sure that they went the extra mile for their guests who were their number one priority in my experience.  The suites are excellent, almost everything that you required for a great stay was in the more the generous space.

Location is excellent and everything seemed to be well organised with Covid measures in place (screens, sanitiser, paper cups in the room, no lift sharing). Hotel has its own car park which is £10 a day from arrival to midday on day of leaving (you can then pay £1 ph if you wish to stay after 12pm. Our room overlooked the car park but was very well insulated and quiet,    On the negative side - you can’t book the car park and on arrival (4pm on a Saturday) it was full apart from several disabled spots, ",40,September 2020
ibis Liverpool Centre Albert Dock - Liverpool One Hotel,Trip to Liverpool,"Came away with Mrs for a trip to Liverpool and stayed at this ibis. Have to say it was superb. The location is spot on, 5 mins walk away from docks and 10 from main shopping areas.  Stayed here 2 nights and both nights the staff were brilliant. Very friendly and helpful, nothing too much.  Lovely bar area, also showing sky sports  We paid the extra for the breakfast and was well organised. They give you a sheet of paper with the options and you simply tick what you like. Choice of full English or continental. Plus juices that you get yourself and top up.  Coffee is from a machine that you can help yourself to anytime of the day.  The Covid secure checks and practices they put in place are very good. Everything constantly being cleaned and good one way systems and foot plates to",50,September 2020
Holiday Inn Liverpool City Centre,Excellent,"I rarely give 5 stars but what sets this hotel apart at the moment is the staff. Difficult times as we all know but every member of staff I’ve dealt with has been super friendly and really helpful.  From delivering crockery and cutlery to the rooms, helping out with takeaway deliveries during this lockdown through to arranging a very last-minute breakfast bag at 0530 in the morning for an urgent check-out, they’ve been brilliant. Had chances to chat with those on duty and they’re so happy to help out and they all appreciate the fact that they have a job. Hotel spotless with plenty of sanitiser located everywhere and controlled entry/exit at the front. ",50,January 2021

Z Hotel Liverpool,Lovely Central Location ,Nice hotel in the middle of town by all the attractions. Staff where very friendly and attentive. Hotel was clean and the beds very comfortable. I'd say only thing I'd change is the fact there was only one plug socket so if I go to the Z Hotel again I would take a plug extension or double plug. There was a hairdryer there too which was good and kettle. The ensuite was nice but had frosted glass walls which I didn't mind. The shower was very nice and powerful. I would stop at this hotel again as slept like a baby. ,40,September 2020
Z Hotel Liverpool,Everything was fine..,Basic hotel but nice & clean. Kettle & tea coffee was available in the room. Couldn’t fault anything. Reception staff could be more friendly and approachable.. close to restaurants & bars if visiting Liverpool.,50,August 2020
Z Hotel Liverpool,Brilliant location with great staff and excellent value for money,"Stumbled across this place by accident stranded in Liverpool only to realise that the value for money was amazing, not only that but Jade and Ian despite obvious covid measures absolutely couldn't have done more for me and in such unusual times really created the great, welcoming atmosphere you want when staying in a hotel. Lovely facilities and a nice shower topped off a very pleasant experience during my stay, will definitely return whenever in Liverpool!",50,August 2020
Z Hotel Liverpool,Horrible Experience,Both receptionists were very rude and unpleasant. They tried to embarrass us in front of other guests. No opening windows in room so it was very stuffy. The air conditioning was useless and the room had a strange smell. Wouldn't stay here again. I suggest the staff get some customer service training and some manners.,10,March 2020
Z Hotel Liverpool,Better than the Hilton.,"On arrival the welcome was warm and friendly. Our accessible room was almost perfect-apart from height of bed. We chose not to have breakfast here- Roughhand Made -St Albert's Dock is the place to go.  The room was clean and tidy- less can be said for our stays at Hilton, the welcome was more friendly and less clinical than Hilton and unlike Hilton had no need to complain.  Reasonably priced would stay here again  Photo taken from our room.",50,March 2020

The hotel is tastefully decorated and clean throughout .The hallways are magnificent and the rooms spacious. Only negative was due to covid we couldn't use the bars.Apart from that no complaints  ,50,December 2020
Titanic Hotel Liverpool,Xmas Eve,"We booked here as Manchester was in tier 3 and we were not disappointed. From check in to leaving the service was 5 star, the reception staff are faultless, the concierge so friendly right the way to the maintenance man who all made my 2 year old so welcome, we will certainly be re booking its a fantastic hotel, we didn't get chance to see the pool as its adults only that was the only shame as it would of been good if they did maybe a few hours a day for families",50,December 2020
Titanic Hotel Liverpool,Very unique hotel experience!,"I stayed here for a weekend away and from the second I walked in, the staff were courteous and friendly. It was around Christmas time and the tree in the lobby was stunning!  I stayed in the dockside room, which was expensive but worth it. The biggest hotel room I've ever stayed in; I love the theme of the Titanic. Also visited the Maya Wellness spa w hich was my favourite part of my stay, so luxurious. The only downfall was that the hotel was a bit further away from the city centre than anticipated but luckily we had a car. Thank you for making our trip so special! ",50,January 2020

Heeton Concept Hotel City Centre Liverpool,"Excellent location, very helpful staff","I stayed for 6 nights.  Room and bathroom were both spacious and very clean. The location is excellent - walking distance to shops, restaurants, bars and many tourist interests.  James St Station is right next door and Liverpool One bus station is 5 minutes walk.  Staff are exceptional, friendly and very helpful.  I would highly recommend the hotel  and will definitely stay on my next visit",50,September 2020
Heeton Concept Hotel City Centre Liverpool,Night away,I stayed in this hotel for a week a few years ago when it was the Days inn and had a nice stay. I seen that it looked like it hadn’t changed much since then so decided to try it again for a night. When booking there was only twin rooms available so we had to pay extra for a “King Room”.. which we did. When arriving at the hotel we were placed into a family room adjoining room. Personally I really don’t like adjoining rooms and a King room to me indicates a Kingsize bed. Which I was certain I stayed in last time. I queried this with reception and said I wasn’t keen on staying in an adjoining room. The girl on the desk wasn’t particularly interested and said we had to stay put. Generally the hotel was clean and tidy. Although maybe not to the standard it once was. I would be on,30,September 2020
Heeton Concept Hotel City Centre Liverpool,Basic !,"Stayed over for 1 night after traveling to Liverpool for a family party. Room was very basic & outdated, the whole hotel stank of cigarette smoke, especially the reception & lift areas. It was also very noisy - loud guests & in a noisy location. I wouldn't stay there again.",20,September 2020
Heeton Concept Hotel City Centre Liverpool,"Lovely staff, clean, central but noisy","Stayed with my friend last night. Location is excellent. Very central. Right next to James street train station. The staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful. Check in and out was quick and problem free. We had our night cut short because my friend hurt her knee and the staff immediately offered help. Room was clean and spacious. At 53 quid the price was very reasonable for a Saturday night too.   The only issue was the loud noise from two rooms on our floor who were playing loud thumping music and banging doors, going into one anothers’ Rooms from 3am until 4am. We kept quiet until 4 hoping it would calm down (didn’t want to cause issues. The groups were young. It was a Saturday night) but eventually it got too much and my friend went out onto the corridor and asked them",40,September 2020
Holiday Inn Express Liverpool - Royal Albert Dock,Great first stay,"Decided to stay here for the first time lovely hotel with great views of the docks. Room is nice size, bed comfy, great shower and the food was tasty especially breakfast. had no problems at all the staff were so helpful and very friendly had fantastic service throughout our stay. Will definitely be staying again thank you. ",50,December 2020
Holiday Inn Express Liverpool - Royal Albert Dock,"Brilliant hotel, great location - our favourite place to stay in Liverpool","We go to Liverpool for long weekends several times a year and have stayed at most hotels over the years including the Hilton but the Holiday Inn Express is our absolute favourite. The staff are so friendly, the rooms are large with super comfortable beds and everywhere is really clean. The rooms look our over Albert Dock. The free breakfast is a bonus and one of the nicest we’ve had. We stayed here with friends just before restrictions hit Liverpool and the hotel were really careful in managing the Covid risk without being too obtrusive. Really well handled.  The location is just perfect being on Albert Dock with lots of  great restaurants and bars on the doorstep and The Beatles Story just a short walk away. Can’t recommend highly enough.",50,September 2020
Holiday Inn Express Liverpool - Royal Albert Dock,Small room,"I had previously stayed at the nearby Premier Inn but the bedrooms in the Holiday Inn Express looked so much bigger.  Unfortunately ours wasn’t and with the sofa bed out we could hardly move so wished I had returned to the Premier. Covid restrictions here meant no housekeeping, choosing your limited breakfast and eating it from a paper bag. The experience was not great. It was no fault of the staff who were on the go all the time. I think covid has been used for portion control and keeping staff to a minimum. The passageways by contrast were huge. The beds were comfortable. The hotel was handy for the sites and shopping and the view from the room over the docks was lovely.",30,August 2020
Holiday Inn Express Liverpool - Royal Albert Dock,3rd stay but definitely our last,"This would be our 3rd stay at the holiday inn,  Liverpool Albert socks, so many great memories of trips up to Scotland, this year not so much.   Covid precautions seemed pretty good, room was clean, tidy, outside windows filthy as always so no amazing photos of the docks but we knew that from previous stays.   Third floor, 6pm, shower broken and no hot water, of course, what do you, well you suck it up and finish your shower because, well there isn’t much else you can do.   So on leaving the building for dinner we decided to inform reception, not necessarily to get any money but just to get an apology or maybe a complimentary drink at the bar.   What was the response, oh yer, sorry, that sometimes happens with the boiler, you should have called down at the time and we could have",20,October 2020
Holiday Inn Express Liverpool - Royal Albert Dock,"Great hotel, great location",We had to change the booking and they kindly kept the lower price.  The breakfast is very good and the staff are lovely.  If you park out front it is £20 for 24 hours but you get better deals parking at Liverpool one.  The location is really very very good if you are visiting Liverpool.  My one and only complaint is that the beds are doubles - too small.  You are much better off getting a room with two singles,50,October 2020
Village Hotel Liverpool,Middle finger to Covid,Stayed for business due to Covid it was absolutely shocking what was on offer which I would say is understandable but as when booked there were less restrictions in place then when I stayed more harsh ones in place and still paid full prices to have to sit in the room I think was a joke no thoughts on a pergola refund. Very very expensive for a night sat in a room. Ordered room service chips were soggy turned up in cardboard boxes very over priced for what was received over all very disappointed on value for money. Hotel/room/!staff etc were fine as usual ,30,December 2020
Village Hotel Liverpool,If you need somewhere standard to stay at a cheap price then this is for you.,"Rooms and bathrooms weren’t the cleanest, also not that modern. Don’t expect top quality! But for a cheap price it’s not a bad stay if you aren’t in Liverpool for long. However, food in the restaurant was very nice and the staff were attentive and pleasant. ",20,December 2020
Village Hotel Liverpool,Cheap on a deal but wouldn’t return,"We booked on the Winter Weekend deal. It was very cheap and can’t complain about that. The hotel is clean and well presented. The customer service was very much lacking and it made the stay less special. I feel that I would have felt more wanted staying at home. The staff are over worked or useless depending on how you look at it. The gym staff were pathetic, lazy and rude. This is very much a budget hotel so you have to lower expectations at the door I’m afraid. I wouldn’t return but I appreciated it was a good deal. It’s no better than travelodge or premier inn.  ",20,December 2020
Village Hotel Liverpool,The Village Liverpool,"Too noisy, we asked for a quiet room but were given a room with noisy guests either side.  Maintenance man doing repairs next to our room at 7am!! Wouldn’t even apologise.  I guess you get what you pay for",10,December 2020
Village Hotel Liverpool,Very AVERAGE,I have stayed in around 10 different Village Hotels.. By far this is the worst. I would not recommend staying here. The lady at reception was very friendly and nice. The room was out dated and musty. I was very surprised  - I was in room 315. The location was good. Just disappointed in the general about the room,20,December 2020

Ibis Styles Liverpool Centre Dale Street - Cavern Quarter Hotel,Weekend Stay,"My partner and I stayed here for a 3 night stay in September 2020. Hotel was in a very central location, short walk to many pubs, restaurants and shops, we did not use public transport at all during our stay. The recommended car park is also close by and the hotel provide a discount for using this which is really helpful as it is quite expensive but very safe and secure to leave your car parked up. There is a Tesco express right next door to the hotel which is handy if you need anything.   We stayed in an executive room which was very spacious, large bed, en-suite bathroom, wardrobe and dressing table. The room was nicely decorated (plane/travelled theme) and was very clean. Due to current coronavirus restrictions, the room was only cleaned after we had finished our stay.",40,September 2020

Ibis Styles Liverpool Centre Dale Street - Cavern Quarter Hotel,Excellent,"Hospitality is all about people.  Ibis has nailed it by having an excellent team at the Liverpool Centre hotel. Very helpful and friendly staff who provided us guidance on eveyrthing we needed. We had our pet staying with us and they helped store his wet food in the kitchen for us, which ensured he had his food fresh when he needed it!  They maintained excellent measures to ensure we do our best to prevent spreading COVID19. Always wore masks, had sanitizers everywhere and also ensured that even lift access was restricted with a very obvious notice board. This is something I truly appreciate as I have seen places where the rules state something and what they practiced were a bit contradictory.  The complementary breakfast was simple but fulfilling. Being vegans, they kindly",50,September 2020
Ibis Styles Liverpool Centre Dale Street - Cavern Quarter Hotel,Comfortable night in a quirky room,"We stayed for 1 night. The room was quite small but enough for the 1 night.

Hampton by Hilton Liverpool City Centre,"Awesome service, nice rooms, good breakfast and okay location.","My abiding memory of the Hampton by Hilton Liverpool City Centre will be the service that I received from the fantastic staff and management; efficient, professional and friendly always going that extra mile to make sure that my stay was superb.  The room was very good, nice décor and on the whole very clean, the shower room was contemporary. TV and Wi-Fi were also very good.  The bed was extremely comfortable and complimented with some excellent linen and a nice duvet.

The hotel is in a good position and about 25 minutes walk from Lime Street station.   Check in was easy and I was in my room in minutes. The hotel was virtually empty due to Covid tiers being changed that day.   The hotel had good procedures in place and the breakfast was well organised with a very friendly and helpful lady helping.

Hampton by Hilton Liverpool City Centre,A decent option for Liverpool,"We stayed at the Hampton By Hilton Liverpool City Centre for one Saturday night in early December. I always think Hamptons represent very good value for money and are purely practical, but arriving at this Hampton I was very impressed by the classy lobby and mezzanine area.   The rooms are the standard Hampton set up and I am a big fan of the shower and on-wall soaps (no fiddly bottles or wastage). The room was a decent size, even with the sofa bed pulled out and the television was very modern. The room appeared clean, but unfortunately my daughter, who wanted to sit at the desk, pulled out the chair and found some dirty brown marks on it (let's assume it was chocolate!), that then put her off using the chair, even though she had a go at cleaning it herself.  Unfortunately we",30,December 2020

The Dolby Hotel Liverpool,Bargain,It’s as simple as this for the price you pay it is an absolute bargain. The location is on the Docks so would cost probably double per night. The added bonus of free parking and free WiFi is a no brainer. As mentioned in other reviews the room are small and the bathroom is compact but spotlessly clean and a fantastic base to explore Liverpool. The gentleman who checked us in was fantastic and very friendly. We were fortunate as it was quiet to be given a view over the docks simply breathtaking. We will definitely be trying to book this hotel when in Liverpool again. Keep up the good work thanks guys.,50,October 2020
The Dolby Hotel Liverpool,Ideal value for money stay near centre of Liverpool,"I was attracted to the Dolby Hotel since it offered good rates for a centrally located hotel, ideal location near the waterfront and centre and especially free car parking - a definite plus when staying in town or city centre accommodations. The hotel itself was exactly what I hoped for: comfortable room with small en suite, fast and stable wi-fi and everywhere was spotlessly clean. They were very careful in their coronavirus precautions and instructions to the guests as to what to do were clear (and communicated in advance of my trip). The hotel dealt with my change of duration and dates made at short notice very efficiently. My only criticism was the signage outside: I missed the small sign showing how to get to the hotel once you've turned off the main road so spent a few",50,October 2020

The Dolby Hotel Liverpool,"Small, cheap with free parking ","I stayed here for past 2 days with my husband and 10 year old son. We booked 2 nights without breakfast for £70 which was much cheaper than a lot of Dock front hotels. Room was small but perfect to be slept in. Perfect location to explore the docks, beatles story and Liverpool one shopping centre. Online free parking was the main selling point for us. We had room 6 which was on the ground floor and looked onto the docks. We'd defo stay here again. ",50,October 2020

Premier Inn Liverpool City Centre (Albert Dock) Hotel,Great place,Booked a night here for a family break. Paid £35 for a family room. Great location right on the docks close to loads of restaurants and only 10 minute walk to shops. Only downside was slow check in as everyone comes at the same time. If you could get there a bit later I’m sure it would be much quicker. Rooms bigger than average with all usual amenities. It’s nice to see the original features of the building including the old windows which are double glazed. The hotel is bigger than you think as we seemed to walk a mile to our room!! Staff are all very friendly and smiley and bar was pleasant for a last drink as the bars around the docks all seemed to close at 10pm though that could be a COVID thing.

Yes, checkin was slow but the character of the place made up for that - suggest though that they try to have 2 staff members checking people in.

Room- average Went to bed 12ish, party next door, thought the room were all double but there was at least 6 people in there, music really loud, rang reception at 12.30am to ask if they could come up and listen to the noise. No one came up. By 2.30am it was unbearable and my husband had to bang on the walls and shout in the corridors to shut them up. We would have checked out but both of us had been drinking so unable to drive. Really disappointed, spoilt a weekend we looked forward to. Checked out at 8.30am !!!",10,December 2020

Campanile Liverpool,Great for the price,"This hotel is great for the price, clean and tidy a little dated but rooms are big and bed is comfy. The road can be a little noisy so asked for a dock vue an should be fine. Walking distance to Alexander Dock where all the shops an sites are, also five-minute walk to the brewery village where there are some great pubs like the peaky blinders an yellow submarine.  So for somewhere just to sleep this place is perfect it does have a bar an restaurant as well but due to covid was limited so didn't use. ",50,September 2020

Excellent for the docks area, great ample car parking  Food in the evening was good - Small choice that would have met most people’s needs, quick service, good proportions well cooked.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Liverpool",Wow - how low can you go?,Hookers walking in and out of the hotel like lemmings during the COVID-19 pandemic. No water provided in the rooms. Dinner options were either pizza or tuna melt panini - the scouse special was off for all 3 nights I stayed there. Air-con does not work. Lighting was poor and there were several blown bulbs. Breakfast was atrocious - and they forgot to provide it on the last day.  Over charged for dinner service?!,10,February 2021
"Radisson Blu Hotel, Liverpool",Afternoon tea,We didn’t stay over here but we had a group on voucher for afternoon tea here which I’d received from a colleague for Christmas. Myself and my partner came February 2020 after making a straight forward booking. It was nice to get in from the cold and the rain and the friendly women behind the bar took us to a small area set up to the side of the bar and it was nice and contemporary. Coffees were good as was the glass of Prosecco. Sandwiches and cakes were nice and not too heavy which meant I enjoyed it without feeling too bloated! Very nice.,40,February 2020
"Radisson Blu Hotel, Liverpool",Not Covid Safe ,"Avoid this hotel as it is not Covid safe. This hotel stipulates that they deep clean every room before you arrive. We found this to be untrue as upon arrival we could not find the television remote control, after looking under beds and between the beds we found about 6 pieces of broken glass, a cigarette stump and sweet wrappers. We informed the hotel of this and offered us a different room, we decided to stay in our room as we had unpacked and it was about 19.30 hrs. Later that evening we found more glass In the bathroom, so the following morning we asked reception for our room to be throughly cleaned due to our findings. The receptionist happily agreed and we left for work. On our return later that day we entered our room to find more glass still under the beds and a dirty",10,January 2021

The Kent Hotel,Excellent location and helpful staff,"We stayed for three nights and had an exceptional experience. All the staff were brilliant  starting with Leandro the bellman who was first to help us through the doors with the luggage. The reception staff went over and above to answer any questions we had. Having stayed before some ten years ago the refurbishment has been immense. Although they don't offer breakfast the American diner on 11th street, five minutes away, does offer reasonable meals which were great.  We would certainly stay again when returning to South Beach one of our favourite places.",50,February 2020

Mantra on Kent Sydney,Major A/C issues,"The good: Location, room layout, staff, cleanliness - all good.  The A/C in our room was blowing extremely cold air. The switch to adjust the fan wouldn’t respond, the thermostat adjustment was futile, and even turning the A/C off didn’t work so we had to turn it off at the switchboard.   To the hotels credit they did supply a portable heater but on the days when heat wasn’t needed it was a choice between being frozen or having no air. We were advised changing rooms wouldn’t achieve anything so clearly there is a systemic problem.   As a Gold Accor member we will stay loyal to Accor but it will be back to the Novotel or Sofitel next time. ",30,February 2021

Hilton Garden Inn Kent Island,Ho hum,"I had the worst noise disturbance I have had in 20 years of regular travel. If you are randomly assigned a connecting room, consider changing it. The doors between rooms are thin and provide little insulation from noise from the next room. Despite what seems like modern construction the HVAC system is inadequate for the suite we paid extra for; the unit is on the far side of the room so temperatures in the room were inconsistent from one side to the other. The location is great and the staff is friendly. ",30,December 2020
Hilton Garden Inn Kent Island,Agree with others,"This was a great hotel in a beutiful setting.  With all the boat and car traffic, we heard nothing in our room, very quiet.   Room was fantastic.   Service from the moment we got in early to chekout was great.  Starting to serve hot breakfast on a limited menu but it's nice to get it without leaving the hotel.

Everything was very nice and we WILL be back this summer!  thank you.  ",50,March 2021
Kent State University Hotel & Conference Center,Fantastic as always!,My recent stay in Kent was due to my KSU Student / Athlete daughter having knee surgery.

Best Western Kent Narrows Inn,Best on the Western or East Coast of Maryland,Driving to Florida from NJ we got a late start and decided to stop for the night. Needed a pet friendly hotel - the BW in Easton did not accept pets however the 800 reservationist searched for one that did close by. Limited time to check TA reviews so we took a chance and are so glad we did. Friendly front desk employee immediately made me feel comfortable but the next and most important test was room cleanliness - 5 out of 5 stars. Will keep this on my list of favorites on TripAdvisor and once you stay there you will too. Happy Thanksgiving!,50,November 2020

"Old Kent Estates, Coorg",33000 INR for a substandard accomodation,"First the pros: - Excellent estate, long walks, singing birds, beautiful flowers - Sampath and his assistants, they are making the impossible possible - They are the reason this place is not shut down. Their commitment is the only reason because the management doesn't seem to care. If it weren't for Sampath and his relentless need to help customers, it would have been an unbearable 2 days for us. - The management was kind enough to postpone my booking when I approached them with an unavoidable circumstance that was stopping me from travelling - The management was kind enough to not charge us 600 INR for 2 coffees and a sandwich we ordered after the unhappiness I showed about the state of the sofas  The cons: - The sofas were stained, the least the management can do is at least",20,November 2020
"Old Kent Estates, Coorg",Visit to the Old Kent Coorg during Pandemic,"After a long lockdown and spending almost 6 months at home, I and my wife decided to go to Coorg. After doing lots of research keeping Covid-19  and our safety in mind, we booked the Old Kent resort. We stayed there in 3rd week of October2020 Everything went per plan. We drove in our Honda City via Neelamangala-Hasan road following Googlemaps.  There was absolutely no issue on the way. Road was in good condition except few kilometers here and there with little bumpy road.  On the way we stopped at Swathi Delicacy restaurant which is very neat and clean. The restaurant guys take order in your car and serve the food there, so you don’t risk yourself exposing to too many people in the restaurant. We reached Coorg in around 6 hours from Bangalore.

And this turned out to be the perfect choice! We loved every bit of it - the location, quaint cottages with huge baths, food and hospitality. We spent long hours exploring the plantation and were truly impressed by the professional management of the estate. We also went for the plantation tour and special thanks to Sampath for explaining the entire process and the various varieties of coffee and pepper. And also Mr. Binu Rajendra, Mgr - Resv & Guest Relations was extremely helpful and most courteous through the entire process of reservation.

The view from the cottage is awesome.. we could gaze into the green hills.. We hung out on our porch, main villa porch (where the food is served), watched a movie, read books. What we enjoyed the most was the well-marked trails. we did those everyday, sometimes twice a day. The tour of the coffee estate and learning about it was also interesting.   The food was awesome..

Napoleon on Kent,Great location,My wife and I stayed here in feb 2020 for a week.  We arrived late at 12 am and used the intercom to call a night porter (Off Site) to gain access to the building and safe where our keys were with some documentation advising us to complete checkin in the morning. I can`t remember the room number but we faced the sea underneath the flyover on the top floor.  We quickly gained access and unpacked after a long trip from scotland and fell asleep on the comfy bed with clean sheets.  We woke up refreshed and had a coffee with the supplied sachets in the room.  We went down  to reception to complete our check in which is only manned from say 0800 to 1700 and all was fine.  The lady on reception was friendly and highlighted some local points of interest.  The room was clean with clean,40,April 2020
Napoleon on Kent,Long Term Stay,"One of the best places to stay if you look for a fair quality-price balance (3 months in our case).

Napoleon on Kent,Do Not Book this Accommodation ,"When you book and pay for accommodation, only to find out you cannot access the building out of hours i.e 6pm.  I am absolutely gobsmacked that businesses like this still exist.  Not only do they take $100 bond + my booking fee, for my outlay, I now cannot get access to the apartment... that seems like fair trade.  Lesson: You Get What You Pat For!!!

Was easy to walk to harbor, into the heart of the city, the Rock, even the Opera House. Front desk people were very helpful.  Bed comfortable, carpet was clean, lots of room.  This is not a hotel. What didn’t work?   You get 1 bath towel each, 1 hand towel for 2 people, no wash cloth, and 1 bath mat that looked dirty.  The shower could use some bleach as there was some mold. We like to use a hand towel for our face but once again one hand towel for two.  If you wanted another towel you had to pay $2.00.   It would have been nice to have been able to exchange dirty towels at front desk.  Maybe the owners can think about this",30,January 2020
Napoleon on Kent,Ideal location next to Barangaroo.,"OK, a hotel underneath a freeway does not sound that inviting, but would have to say our apartment on the 4th floor really carried no traffic noise to speak of, and the location is ideal for several reasons. The Wynyard station is practically underneath, complete with access to a Coles supermarket, and it took me ten minutes to walk to Circular Quay and about the same to walk to Darling harbour. Packers casino complex here is close to completion at Barangaroo if that is your thing. As for the hotel, it is showing its age, but has all the basics for a short stay, with a kitchenette, and a coin operated laundry down in the basement/car park.Depending on the time of year, the price of these units was quite reasonable considering others around it with maybe a better profile Plenty",30,December 2019

We received a lovely warm welcome when we arrived and the staff couldn't have been more helpful throughout our stay. Our room was on the first floor and its modern decor blended with the character of the original building. The bed was really comfortable and along with hairdryer, refreshments and TV there was free WiFi. It was close to all the bars, restaurants and shops and the City Centre was within walking distance but a bus service ran from just outside the hotel.

Best Western New Kent Hotel,Handy Hotel for an Overnight Stay,"This was our first stay and yes, it’s a basic hotel and needs a revamp but in these times, you cannot expect anything else. The room was equipped with coffee but no tea? The bed was comfy and everything worked in the room. I just felt that it needed a good clean...there was a stain on the chair, the carpet had various stains on it and the “extra” blanket that was stored in the wardrobe had definitely seen better days. There was a pair of nail clippers in the bedside drawer which had obviously been left by a previous guest, and there were parts of the room that had not seen a duster for a while.

I went on the idea that it was close to where I used to live in Milton Keynes many moons ago, I used to train at the sport centre there, I used to walk in my beloved little woods close by all the time and the name Conference Centre sounds like it has executive standard accommodation. I couldn't have been more wrong.  First of all, upon check in, the staff were pleasant but the walk to the room was ridiculously far through cold corridors and bleak halls.

Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham Kent/Sea-Tac Airport,Nothing Good About This Hotel,"Property and Rooms are In Complete Disrepair. So many issues I can't fit them in this rating. Just one example, when I arrive the sink was full of water and wouldn't drain. I had to dig out a rock that was in the disposal, reset the disposal, and drain the sink. So many more problems. Don't even bother to consider this place. ",10,December 2020
Holiday Inn Express Kent Island,Good Property,"Stay Report - 12/16 to 12/17  Location: The Annapolis East name is a total joke.  This hotel is located a good 25 minutes east of Annapolis across the Bay Bridge.  Kent Island is accurate: that's exactly where it's located.  Just off US 50 right on the water in fact.  Nearby are a few restaurants, a Royal Farms gas station and a McDonalds.  Being right on US 50 makes it easy to get to the Eastern Shore or back to the mainland.    Hotel: The hotel is an above average HIX.  It's a new construction building and built fairly recently.  There's a small outdoor pool behind the hotel along with a little dock and some chairs right by the water.  The lobby has a small snack shop, a breakfast area, a meeting room and a business center.  There's also a really large parking lot out front.

Holiday Inn Express Kent Island,A Hotel With A Stunning View,"The Holiday Inn was a great hotel to stay at. I asked for a waterfront room, and I was spoiled by the stunning view! Each day during my stay I saw Great Blue Herons on the edge of the salt marsh right outside my window. The room was very well-cleaned for it having just become vacant. It was spacious and quiet with all the amenities that one would expect in a Holiday Inn room.  The staff was extremely positive and polite, and they made sure their guests enjoyed themselves even during a world-wide pandemic. The go-to-breakfast was much appreciated. The pool was very enjoyable to be in, with a view that again, could not be beat. Plenty of free parking and easy access to all that Kent Narrows and the Island had to offer completed my stay.

Hampton Inn Kent/Akron Area,Get what you pay for,"The staff at the Hampton is very friendly and helpful. We were greeted each time we approached the desk with a smile and an effort to help. The rooms were large and clean with a comfortable bed and pillows. We were disappointed in the breakfast offerings, but know that this is a difficult time for breakfast at hotels. Breakfast was a prepackaged bagel, cream cheese, and 2 packaged hard boiled eggs that tasted like vinegar. Muffins were off to the side as well.  Our biggest problem was the way the noise carried from the room above. It seemed like you could hear them even think about moving. Every step sounded like a herd of elephants was stampeding over our heads. We recommend staying on the 3rd floor.   Overall it was an appropriately priced stay. We would not have paid more",30,December 2020

Hampton Inn Kent/Akron Area,Covid is excuse for no services,"Stayed here in late June 2020 with two rooms.  At check-in, noticed the main floor bathroom mens room was filthy and out of toilet paper.  This was odd, as covid sanitation has been the norm for months.  The next day, and the day after that it got worse.  Hadn't been touched.  Neither of our rooms was serviced by housekeeping until I complained, and I was told we had to ask for this.  This is absurd.  The trash can on our floor by elevator was full when we arrived, and was overflowing 3 days later.  Pool was not only off limits, but totally drained.  Breakfast was bagged, and bad.   No hot coffee.   Marriott properties at least will get you coffee and some hot food.  The hotel sits beside I-76 and 43.  A lot of noise due to traffic all night.

I felt it was a good value and the important things to me (cleanliness, quiet, and comfort) were more than acceptable. The only issue during my 4 day stay was one night a loud guest was in a room above me stomping around being loud after midnight.

Ramada by Wyndham Kent Seattle Area,Not too bad,"Nice clean room  but the hair dryer was broken and the shower head was missing. The maintenance person came immediately to replace the shower head. I wish the smoking policy could be reinforced by stiffer penalties. The smells in the hallway were awful and the ""other substance"" smell made my throat sore even with quickly closing our door. Don't know why the smoke alarm was not set off. The bad part was gong through Booking.com. I went only through their website so did not see the hotel website saying no breakfast is provided during the pandemic. Booking.com did not make that clear.

But the real thing here is Kent's hospitality and wonderful food preparation.  Kent greeted us warmly, carried our bags upstairs to our room, helped us get our bicycles secured/put away in the garage, and oriented us to the B&B and our room.

Many extra touches were provided in the room such as robes, slippers, tea coffee making facilities and bottled water and there were also homemade cookies downstairs for guests to enjoy.

Holiday Inn Ashford North A20,AMAZING HOTEL WITH AMAZING MORALS,"In the crisis of all the lorries being stuck over the Christmas period of 2020, a German driver reached out to me stating that all he was in desperate need of a shower. He had been stuck for 4 days. I saw that his location was right next to the holiday inn. I reached out to the holiday inn and explained that there was a driver and some colleagues that was stuck on the motorway, in need of a shower. The holiday inn did not hesitate to help these drivers freshen up. They also supplied Hot food, crisps, biscuits, fruit, and unlimited tea and coffee for them too. They even sent staff down to the motorway to inform the drivers of what services they are offering. The Manager Howard is so kind, and generous.

Holiday Inn Ashford North A20,Useful hotel,"Stayed here again for an overnight before heading back to the Continent. Bit of a wait at reception because the only person on duty there was busy elsewhere, but not much of a problem for us.  The room was clean and spacious, but we were near the end of the wing closest to the motorway, so for the first time in all our stays here we had a bad night because of the traffic noise.  We were hoping to nip over to the pub across the parking for some dinner, but they were closed so we ended up using the hotel restaurant - the menu was a bit limited as they had run out of several things, but we both had a very good steak. Service at dinner was commendable - very friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  Breakfast was standard fare and did the job.Checkout was quick, efficient and",40,January 2020

They were excellent hosts; friendly, knowledgeable about the history of Cork City, helpful in advising on the places of interest to visit and the best places to eat out in. The house has so much character - it was even a police station at one time. It's near the railway station and a 5-10 walk from the City Centre and Bus Station. My room was clean and spacious; with a comfortable bed, nice en-suite with a great shower, small fridge, tea/coffee making facilities and a safe. Lorraine cooks a very tasty breakfast.

London Beach Country Hotel & Spa,A gem of a hotel,I stayed here with family for a long weekend.  The first thing that struck us was the relaxed nature of the setting; this place does not have that corporate hotel feeling about it.  The second thing that struck us was how helpful and friendly all the staff were.    The only downside was the very basic breakfast but this was explained to us before we arrived.  Notwithstanding this the hotel was able to cater for my wife who is gluten free.  She had a lovely fruit salad which she enjoyed.  We would definitely stay at this place again.,40,October 2020

Holiday Inn Express Canterbury,Short break to Canterbury,"It’s a budget hotel and we are aware of their typical limitations; fair few miles outside of the named town, pretty basic, etc. but we only wanted it as a base to explore the coastal area.   Was charged £3/night parking. Reasonable but don’t recall seeing that on the website???  Location off A2 through the petrol station doesn’t look great.   Doesn’t have a lift so have to carry luggage up stairs, could be an issue to some people.   We were in an odd numbered room on first floor (oddly though numbered in 200 range) which is at ‘rear’ of hotel and was quiet for traffic noise, even with window open. However, overlooking their maintenance yard and hum of some extraction/ventilation unit (?) wasn’t great.   Rooms are fine and comfy beds so tick those boxes. One paper cup each for",30,October 2020

Totally recommend the chicken with peppercorn sauce for evening meal 💯. Restaurant open in evening with limited menu & social distancing observed. The staff really care about the customer and it shows. Chef came and asked if we were happy with meal and Dila on reception always had a smile and was asking if she could help with anything.

The views are spectacular, even better in reality than on the internet. The staff were fabulous, couldn’t have been more helpful and attentive.    Food at breakfast and dinner (were stayed on a B&B basis but chose to eat in the hotel on two evenings) was wonderful, especially the omelettes! The cocktails in the bar were also excellent.

Excellent food with breakfast and dinner from the restaurant also with stunning views - as the hotel is built up the cliff face there are views from everywhere!  Also excellent service from the restaurant team and concierge. Half board was a good choice. Pool is lovely too. Amazing original artwork on all the walls throughout the public areas - well worth exploring to see it all.   There is some traffic noise due to the location - the higher rooms are quieter.

The view from our balcony was stunning. Plus the restaurant view is equally good. The staff were excellent throughout whether it was the reception team, the Porter, the cleaning staff or the waiting staff in the restaurant. We chose half board and weren’t disappointed. The breakfast buffet had lots of choice and Luca was always happy to take your order for hot food. The poached eggs were perfect every time (I need tips!) and the Torte della nonna was beautiful - definitely recommend.

The rooms, while a little on the small side, are very comfortable, quiet and sparkling clean.  We had no issues during our three night stay and enjoyed the great service.

We had 3 course meal at Cafe Bristol.. and that is wonderful place with amazing interior and atmosfere. But food... Believe me that food was outstanding! You have to give a try! That was probably the best Żurek in my life, one of the best Salmon and great ice creams. I have been eating in Spain, Italy, Greece, England or Dominican Republic but Bristol's kitchen just jumped to my first 3 for sure. Give a payrise to you Chefs.

The hotel is on top form and was a wonderful home away from Lodon, Covid notwithstanding. I was accommodated in an exceptional, extremely large suite with a view of the Eiffel Tower, which had been arranged prior to my arrival with a convenient desk and surrounding working area. Naturally adjustments have had to be made to make the hotel Covid secure, but these are pretty unobtrusive and convenient kits were provided with masks, wipes and sanitiser.

I had a super old-school room, but it was very well-maintained, and comfortable. Also very quiet, due to the long corridor from the door to the bedroom, and the second door to shut off the bedroom.

Great detailed touches, like the super attentive turndown service, apple bowls on every floor, coffee in the lobby - the list goes on.  Did not try the restaurant, but we did enjoy nightcaps at the bar several times during our stay, which I highly recommend.  A bit like stepping back in time, with delicious cocktails by the very knowledgeable bartender.

We had booked to classic rooms originally.  When we arrived, our deluxe rooms were not ready yet, so we were upgraded again to 2 duplex suites!

Convenient city-centre location (though not easy to drive to as Bristol has changed all its road layouts recently).  Car park not easy to get in or out of in a large car (I managed to damage two of my alloys despite driving very slowly).  Room was clean and comfortable.  Room service dinner was so-so, but breakfaast was excellent.   Bed was very comfortable.  Be aware that the bathroom has a glass door (one of our pet hates).  Location was very quiet, but that was due to the city being deserted (I suspect it would normally be much louder, being opposite the main party area in Bristol).  Staff were welcoming and friendly.

This last weekend I was unfortunate to encounter an issue that disturbed me. The parking is costly (per night) and you would assume your car is safe and parked at the hotel, or I could have parked it myself and paid the same fee. It turns out that as I was checking out of my room, it took them 45 minutes to find my car. The poor young lady was dazzled and confused and you can see it in her eyes to where she was just avoiding me due to embarrassment. She went down to the garage and it was not there, soon after she came back up, with a puzzled look and told me that my car was parked down the street at a different location.

I actually liked that you are able to open the window slightly, just enough to let the breeze in.  I needed a last minute reservation and was able to find it here. If you enjoy walking this is the hotel for you. You're just over a half mile walking distance to Little Italy and the Gaslamp Quarters in downtown. If you have a car it might be a bit pricey since there is only valet available. Otherwise you can find street parking nearby. All in all I was very pleased and will make it my go to place when I visit San Diego.",50,March 2021
The Bristol Hotel San Diego,Great Stay,"Had a wonderful time at hotel,everyone I came into contact was great especially Rose and Chris. They are true ambassadors to your organization. The rooms were large and very well appointed thanks and I will be back",50,February 2021
The Bristol Hotel San Diego,"Great location, affordable and sanitary!","The room was pretty clean and sanitized. It was in a great location for a first timer or a tourist. Also, the staff were very friendly. Finding parking spot was kind of challenging in that area and hotel only offered flat fee valet parking for overnight which was quite expensive!!!($40) ",30,September 2020
The Bristol Hotel San Diego,Over and above,"It was our 17th wedding anniversary, so we decided to do a short overnight stay at this hotel, as they had a great deal online. Booked the room(City King), and got confirmation. We are born and raised here in San Diego, so we've stayed at numerous hotels in the city. This hotel was a great addition to our staycation list.  We had a room on the top floor, and had a few minor issues. We called down to the front desk, and were taken care of right away. In the midst of a pandemic, with all the stresses of the world going on, it's a blessing to still be treated with the utmost professionalism and kindness. Kudos to all of the staff we had the chance to interact with, as each of them went above and beyond to make sure we were accommodated and taken care of. Bianca, Chris(valet), Rosa,",40,November 2020
Hesperia Bristol Playa,Much needed winter sun break!,"We have just returned from a week at the Hesperia Bristol PLAYA. Overall we were happy with the hotel, we were looking for a relaxing holiday which this hotel fit perfectly. The room was clean, had basic kitchen facilities but all you need to make a few meals. We did book a 'new style' room which I'm not sure we got as the furniture was rough round the edges and we noticed other rooms getting a refurb. But it was fine. Bit annoying our balcony never saw the sun so didn't really use it other than to dry clothes. The pool area and bar was lovely, bar staff were super friendly even when busy, food was good and good prices. Only thing is the pool and pool bar opening times. Pool 10am-6pm which isn't long enough really and the pool bar closed at 8pm so felt like you had to go out in",40,March 2020
Hesperia Bristol Playa,Once we can travel we'll go back.,"Initially we asked for an upstairs room and were given 170 on the ground.It was a nightmare 175 - 170 are above the supermarket, base beat from 7am - 10 pm, the laundry- Tumble driers, the deliver area , and where the cleaners started every morning with their loaded trolleys (no problem s with them). I complained about the music and was advised every resort in Spain is allowed,in the Supermarkets to play music however loudly they want 8-10....not happy. Also the bedroom is next to the walkway to all the other rooms so every arrival,almost wheeled their cases past the bedroom from 3 in the morning...obviously only on change over day. Asked for a room change, very accommodating His also advised sea view no Sun- pool view sun so if you want the sun in the afternoon always book a",50,February 2020
Hesperia Bristol Playa,Short break , We have been many times and is as lovely as always...really clean and tidy. Pool area is great with lovely bar and lovely bar staff. Some refurbishments of furnishings  going on which is nice to see. You really do get great value for money here.,50,March 2020
Hesperia Bristol Playa,Very Noisy during refurbishment,I returned because I was happy staying here. Accomodation and location are great. But this trip I have been woken up 5 of the last 6 mornings about 8 am with room refurbishment work taking place. Complainant to reception promised action but noise continues. Very disappointed with my stay this time.,10,March 2020
Hesperia Bristol Playa,Hotel Website Services Advise Pet Friendly........INCORRECT,Booked a five day break at this supposedly pet friendly hotel only to be turned away at reception with our small dog without any offer of assistance Pity the service offered across The Hesperia Group is inconsistent,10,March 2020
Bristol Panama,Great service and value,"Because of the competition among luxury hotels in Panama, the price of the Bristol has come down considerably, since the times when it was the clear Nr. 1 in town. Nevertheless, this is still a fine luxury hotel with excellent service, a serene atmosphere, and good food. Only the pool area is not at the highest level.",50,February 2020
Bristol Panama,Lovely Property & Good Sleeping,"We stayed at the Bristol three nights ahead of a cruise. We picked it due to its location in the middle of downtown.  Check-in was fast and smooth. Our room was fine thought the view was just awful. Oh well - we spent little time gazing out the window anyway. We were at the end of a hall and it was quiet and we slept well. The bathroom was fine though a glass wall and door is not the best idea...(there is a pull sheer curtain for some privacy).  We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant every day and it was quite good and well better than average. We also ate one lunch and one dinner there and the food was, again, very good. There are two bars and we visited both (of course we did...) and came to enjoy lounging in the first floor bar which is both cozy and pleasant.   Pricing was",40,February 2020
Bristol Panama,Awesome hotel,"Quality is superb! Although you might think is expensive, other hotels charge the same for less quality and average services.  We stayed there during Carnival and it was very quiet which allowed us to relax and rest well.  We also ate at Salsipuedes restaurant and got a massage at their spa",50,March 2020
Bristol Panama,Heavenly bed! Gracious service,"Our corner room was extremely comfortable.  It was well appointed; plenty of space to unpack and hang our belongings. The bed was divine.  The staff was very helpful with directions and advice.  We used uber to get around.  It didn't feel like there was much to see in this neighborhood; the hotel has a good location, but it seemed like a business district.  The breakfast buffet was included in our room.  There were many choices as well as omelets made to order.  Excellent coffee",50,March 2020
Bristol Panama,Weekend at Bristol Panama,"We are very satisfied with the service at Bristol Panama. The workers were very courteous and friendly. The food at the restaurant ""Sal si puedes"" was really good. I recommend this hotel 100%.  Thanks guys!!",50,February 2020
Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel,HAUNTED and spa looks abandoned not even a spa,"he reception was very grand looking but the spa looked abandoned very horrible shouldn’t even be open. In the evening we experienced a paranormal experience in our bedroom it was so weird can’t even explain, our door slammed early hours of the morning we thought there was a cleaner in our room but it was pitch black anyway we was like half sleep half awake so strange to explain and we both seen a lady with a long black cloak to the floor with shoulder pads, crazy! We are a modern day couple and this has never happened to us before. We asked reception if any cleaners would come in while we are sleeping but they said no chance. So yeah can’t believe places like that are open to the public, the reception said they have heard things like this happen before but everyone seemed abit",20,November 2020
Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel,Good position - but make sure the lifts are working!,"We often stay at Marriott hotels, and usually at Cabot Circus but on this occasion stayed at the Royal.  The hotel lobby is very attractive and all the staff are friendly and helpful.  The quality of breakfast was very good, as was the service. However, we were disappointed with the room.  We stayed in the ""newer"" extension,  but despite the quality bedroom & bathroom fittings, we found the room very dark, oppressive, and quite depressing.  I think this was due to the two very dark grey walls in the bathroom, plus two dark red walls in the bedroom with a small window and insufficient lighting.   BUT the one thing that really spoiled our 2 night stay  (Friday to Sunday) was the situation with the lifts.  There was only one working for the many rooms in the extension.   One public",30,October 2020
Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel,Dont expect that hotel feeling ,"Currently staying here for two nights and regretting it, since my last stay they have closed the pool and spa area and the restaurant/bar is now a Miller and Carter. They previously had a spacious bar and reception area, it seems they think the best thing to deal with Covid is to reduce that to a smaller area as part of the Miller crapper chain, basically there is no real bar area and the reception area is cold and empty. Real shame as if I wanted a hotel with a chain restaurant (cough) and no facilities, I would have stayed at a premier inn, what a way to ruin a once lovely hotel. ",10,October 2020
Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel,One night stay.,"In these testing times the hotel was remarkably busy.  The Covid19 protocols all seemed to be compliant.  Lots of signage about one way systems and social distancing.  Mostly it didn't impinge on the experience.  We ate in the Miller & Carter restaurant, which was great.  The Miller & Carter run bar was a whole different experience; rude and aggressive staff.  No service without proving you have scanned in.  ""I have to see the response on your phone"" said the manager in a very aggressive way.  Not sure how that works if I don't have a smart phone, they wouldn't offer a pen and paper sign in.  Don't think about moving chairs!  A table of 5 in the bar wanted to borrow a spare chair from another table.  A member of the bar staff ran into the room shouting that you 'can't move",40,October 2020
Bristol Marriott Royal Hotel,Thank you,"Was a lovely enjoyable stay for me, my partner and 2 teenage boys. Everything was clean and tidy and nothing was too much trouble.

"Radisson Blu Hotel, Bristol",Free stay with Radisson Rewards,"left on Friday evening and returned late on Sunday, I can confirm that three days (if well organised) are enough to visit this town thoroughly. Main goals of this trip were: visit the city and the museums and find very good places to eat and drink… I know, being a travel blogger is hard work, but someone has to do it!  I stayed at the Radisson Hotel located in the city center. I started this mini vacation doing what I prefer: drinking... yes I know, I am so low maintenance!",40,October 2020
"Radisson Blu Hotel, Bristol",Hmm,"Sadly the hotel room was a bit of a letdown, after finding a lump of chewing gum on the plug socket and a big stain on the carpet, we pulled out the chair at the desk to find it covered in hair. The staff were very nice and came and cleared the gum and offered to move rooms but the overall cleaning of this room was poor to say the least. But on a positive note the man serving the breakfast went beyond normal serving and was one of the nicest most helpful staff I have come across, he couldn't do enough for us. So nice too feel welcomed and nothing was to much trouble on the whole all of the staff were helpful and welcoming Just a shame the cleaning was a let down",20,October 2020
"Radisson Blu Hotel, Bristol",Great place and location but not perfect for a 4* hotel,"The hotel is in a great location as you are in the middle of everything. We had a premium room with a city view, 1605. The view was worth everything despite little bits and boobs that could be implemented for a 4*hotel for which we paid £256 for 2 nights including breakfast.  Firstly, we got there and the check-in was alright but with not many informations provided such as check out time or the next day cleaning service, they only provide you a piece of paper instead of telling them. The room was 50/50, no big lights only lamps, no bin in the bedroom just a very small one in the bathroom, we meant to have an espresso machine instead of a kettle but they said it s due to covid which I don’t understand as you touch both of them the same, but, moving forward, we had no cleaning in",40,October 2020
"Radisson Blu Hotel, Bristol",Beautiful view and great location ! ,On arrival ( we were early) our room wasn’t quite ready - the staff on reception where great and we left our bags at the reception desk . They also opened a door to the toilets for us with their key card so we could change after travelling.  We popped back to check in later and were out in room 1303 . I was concerned after reading reviews but the carpets etc were all really clean !   The only issue was my request for a large king bed had been lost in translation and I ended up with two twin beds . We were given the option to change rooms but it was a lovely room and so they made our beds into a double whilst we were out with no hassle at all.   I know a few people have complained about the main entrance not being open and you have to go down a side street but we did not feel,40,October 2020
"Radisson Blu Hotel, Bristol",Staff friendly but room was awful,Decor in the room was very tired and a random mix of styles. Unfortunately our request for a room with view was also not possible as we were looking directly into another building. Breakfast was average. I wouldn’t stay in this hotel again. Only positive was the friendly staff.,20,October 2020
Hotel Bristol Berlin,Highly Professional,I was really pleased with my two night stay here at the end of a longer trip. Staff are extremely friendly from front desk through to the lovely lady serving the breakfast buffet food- Rheinhardts brasserie had an excellent atmosphere and I highly recommend the hotel bar too. My room was comfortable and bright. I'd definitely recommend using the Nespresso coffee plate service. An excellent hotel.,50,October 2020

Hotel Bristol Berlin,Overpriced one star hotel and service ,"First don't trust the pictures on Booking. Com or anyother booking service even the hotels own site, it is even more over priced. Second comparing prices to hotels in Dubai, i would say they rank up to a half star. And this is berlin Germany. I guess the management should take a vacation and visit Dubai to learn about how the world advanced since the fifties or even the 1800s. In dubai for this price tag you get a big tv, water in the room as much as you want, a mini bar and nespresso machine, filled up complimentary every day and by all means a bigger room. Here even the interior design is done by an outdated designer i guess the room coughs old. The only good thing is the location but the price tag is high for the service and the hotel is outdated. They should charge like  35",10,September 2020
Hotel Bristol Berlin,Disappointing,"Although the locaties is perfect, everything else is minor for such a pretentious hotel. Small outdated rooms and bathrooms, no coffee machine on the room, just one bottle of water during a three day stay. Breakfast very limited and be carefull with ordening a glass of wine. The hotel does not have any International wines and charge 12 euro for a cheap small glass of German wine. Our stay was from 16-19 July 2020",20,July 2020
Hotel Bristol Berlin,Not 5 stars at all!!!!!!!!!,"I DO NOT recommend this hotel. The check out and check in took ridiculously long. The first room they gave us was much smaller than the one showed in the pictures and I asked for one similar to the picture so they gave me another room and was ok but you could here the family next door.  We stayed for 2 nights and housekeeping didn't make the room, they replaced the soap in the bathroom but no cleaning at all!!!!!! When we called the reception to ask to they make the room, the answer was that probably we had the ""no disturbe"" paper at the door but we had 2 rooms and any was made. The parking lot is a bit expensive i would say (35 euros the night), we any how decided to take the service and the next day i went to take the care (because they didn't have the valet service) and the",10,May 2020
Village Hotel Bristol,Outstanding! ,"What a quirky hotel, have never stopped here before. Just fantastic. The gentleman working on reception (1/03/2020)was great and very helpful. The room was amazing absolutely spotless, huge bed, Big tv including sky and sky sports (no extra cost) beautiful shower and a snazzy privacy glass feature separating the room from the bathroom. There is nothing about the hotel I can complain about. The one little thing that could be improved is the grab and go breakfast it was a bit basic and it was only a cold choice. Even if it was a breakfast sandwich. Despite this it’s not really a complaint it’s just some feedback for the hotel. I didn’t have dinner on the evening but my work colleague did and said it was great. Will 110% be back hopefully when everything’s back open and when I’m",50,March 2021
Village Hotel Bristol,Love the hotel,I only stayed in the village hotel for 2 nights and I wish I could have stayed longer I loved my room I loved how different it was from other hotels and the staff were incredible nice and wonderful I especially loved the privacy button to make the frosted glass in the bathroom and I absolutely had to try and loved the waterfall shower head its was so nice and relaxing. The staff where really helpful too and so generous. The bed was comfortable too! :) If i ever get to come to Bristol again I'm definitely staying here agian as it's so different to other hotels and really wonderful staff !.,50,December 2020
Village Hotel Bristol,Cant fault it for my needs,"Great hotel and makes a change from boring travelodges.  I was upgraded to a club room and for one person it was perfect would do 2 people but glass door would make it awkward as this doesnt frost over. Bed,staff and room service all great.  No complaints here would stay again ",50,November 2020
Village Hotel Bristol,Ideal place to stay,"I had never stayed in a Village Hotel before and it's certainly different to any other hotel I've stayed in. Different isn't always a bad thing though and, in this case, I was very impressed.   The location isn't scenic and I was worried about the noise from the nearby A38 but am pleased to say that it wasn't an issue at all.  We received a warm and professional welcome. We must have also had an upgrade to a club room. On their website, they do these rooms an injustice (in my opinion) because they make them look like a 5 year old boy's superhero-themed room. In reality, they're pretty funky but very much in keeping with the hotel style. The bathroom is perfect with some nice touches. The bedroom is compact but precisely what you need.  We could only book a half hour pool",50,October 2020
Village Hotel Bristol,Good hotel but need to sort breakfast (scrambled eggs) out ASAP ,"It was a real shame about breakfast most of it was okay but the scrambled eggs the worst I’ve ever had that clearly never ever been near a chicken.  I really need to sort this out because it’s not a cheap breakfast we were never asked how it was.  I think because they didn’t  hear my reaction as obviously we had left most of it. But on a positive note the check-in staff are nice rooms were good the bar seem to be struggling with serving but that’s not unusual in COVID times,",30,October 2020
Hotel Bristol Palace,Breakfast disaster,"The hotel is very well located at walking distance of most things in the city. The design of the hotel is very cozy and luxury at the same time, great amenities in the hotel. However all of this was not enough to make us have a nice stay, since breakfast was a disaster and ended up missing our train. We came at 8;30am and was only served at around 10am.. The hotel had potential.. but didn't live up to it",10,August 2020
Hotel Bristol Palace,Great location but quite tough to park,"The hotel enjoy a great location near all the main places.

Sina Bernini Bristol,"Good location, comfortable, pleasant staff","We enjoyed a five night stay in the Bernini Bristol, well located on the Piazza Barberini and thus within walking distance of many of the major tourist sites.  There’s a metro station outside the door and there was always a queue of taxis on the piazza during our stay.   The hotel is an elegant 20c replacement of the original palazzo.  The  décor is contemporary and tends towards minimalism, a good antidote to the visual overload of Rome’s endless Renaissance art.  Our room (wooden floor) and bathroom (shower over bath) were comfortable, adequately sized and well equipped.   The lighting was particularly good, especially by Italian standards.  Breakfast was an adequate but fairly 'average' buffet with supporting service and good views over the piazza.  We did not use the top",40,February 2020
Sina Bernini Bristol,Exceeded Expectations,"This property was suggested to us while I was contemplating where to stay in Rome by a friend who is a travel professional. I was considering a few ‘big name’ luxury hotels and was not familiar with this property. May I state emphatically how glad I am that we took the advice of my friend?! Everything was honestly as close to perfect as one could expect. From the moment we walked in until the moment we checked out four days later, the staff, the service, the room - just exquisite. I’ve been so many places that had one or the other - either great people but lacking amenities, or a fantastic hotel with so-so staff. And did I mention how convenient and central we were to everything and how spectacular the views were from the rooftop bar? We will definitely plan to stay here in the",50,February 2020

Holiday Inn Bristol - Filton,"Good hotel with good food, other than breakfast","I have been staying here a few times each month for the past 11 years as it's close to a site at work.   Positives: The hotel and rooms are always clean, beds (and bedding) are good and you get a desk and TV. Staff are all really friendly, there's been the odd moody person working there in all the years I've been staying but on the whole, everyone can't do enough to help. Food in the restaurant has always been good, even if you get it ordered to your room. Not a lot of choice for draft beers (Becks or Becks) but they have plenty of bottles.

Ibis Bristol Centre,Plastic straws!,"This IBIS is all about the location. The communal areas are rather soulless and the breakfast isn’t up to much.   I was disappointed to be given plastic straws in a drink from the bar. I didn’t want, nor ask for a straw. Don’t they watch the Blue Planet.   There’s no carpark, but there’s an adjacent, though expensive, NCP.    I understand they don’t clean the rooms during your stay of more than one night during the pandemic, but we should have been advised of this on arrival. Having more than one teabag per person for a two-night stay would have been nice. And the option of dry towels.   Don’t expect any frills. Everything is pared to the bone. A second pillow was supplied on request. ",20,October 2020
Ibis Bristol Centre,Someone in my bed on check in!,"Since I have written to the hotel directly with my complaint, and have had no response, I decided to leave this review.   On check in, I was given my key and went to my room, as I walked in to the room I realized there was a couple in the bed! This was very embarrassing, and obviously I went back to reception to complain.  Although they offered an apology, I was quite annoyed at this, especially considering the current Covid situation, as they had just caused me to walk in to a stranger's bedroom.   The second room was thankfully vacant, but I found the room to be very basic, small and not particularly clean. The bed sheets had stains on, the TV had finger prints all over it, meaning it clearly hadn't been cleaned - again not good under current Covid situation.   The bedroom",20,October 2020
Ibis Bristol Centre,Great night's sleep - shame about the breakfast!,"Nice and central, with lots of (pretty pricy) parking nearby.  We had a spotlessly clean, quiet room and a great night's sleep.  There was a disconcerting group of 7 twenty-somethings congregating in the foyer, masks under their chins, but the staff were properly masked at all times. Our big mistake was having breakfast.  The non-branded brown sauce was really the highlight as the food itself was grim beyond measure. Tepid, cheapest possible ingredients - really one decent hot sausage in a fresh roll would have been  far nicer than the horrible offering we were given. Greying scrambled egg with the texture of tiling grout was a real low point. But the bed was very comfy.",30,October 2020
Ibis Bristol Centre,"Excellent, Modern, Convenient, Harbourside","We loved staying at the Ibis Bristol Centre - it was clean modern, functional and with a large comfortable bed.

Mercure Bristol Brigstow Hotel,5 Star stay at a 4 Star Hotel........,"This was our 8th stay at the Mercure Brigstow in Bristol, on this occasion we booked a privilege room that has a balcony so we could do some relaxed  people watching while enjoying a drink in our room.  From the moment we entered the hotel lobby on Thursday 9th of July until we left on Monday 13th, we were treated in a  warm, friendly, polite, but very professional manner by all of the staff, without exception.  Our room, as usual, was excellent, clean with everything to hand. We ate regularly in the hotels bar area, the restaurant was due to reopen fully the following weekend. Although there was only a limited menu while we were there, the food we did have was very very nice, hot, tasty and reasonably priced. During these ""Covid""  times, the hotel practiced social distancing,",50,July 2020
Mercure Bristol Brigstow Hotel,Barely average,"To be fair the hotel was reasonably priced so for what we paid it was acceptable but the place was a Bit grubby and run down, staff were a bit unprofessional and were playing about most of the time and rubbish from the rooms (empty wine bottles, beer bottles and glasses) that had been cleaned left in the corridor for most of the day and into the evening! But the location was superb and we had a good evening!",30,July 2020
Mercure Bristol Brigstow Hotel,Wonderful service in a great location.,The hotel sits by a cobbled Avenue of trees next to the river giving it a beautiful Parisian feel. It has the most friendly and helpful staff and is clean and charming. The little touches that set them apart from their competition were there from in-room hairdriers and ironing facilities to the attitude of nothing is too much trouble from the staff. Perfect city location with easy walking to all that the city has to offer. I would not stay anywhere else in Bristol.,50,July 2020
Mercure Bristol Brigstow Hotel,"Falling apart , dirty, no lifts, No security.","Having been a regular guest for over 10 years and having spent thousands staying at this hotel in the past I  am  very disgusted at the present state of the building in both cleanliness and worn out rooms. Many comments have been made covering items that don't work or are damaged i can confirm these are true. The NCP Hotel carpark, with hotel discount is alongside the hotel. DO NOT USE THIS NCP CARPARK  You stand  a great chance of having your car broken into and the items stolen from inside.]This is a high risk carpark known to the hotel and police. Having had both my ebikes stolen from inside a locked car NO security , the cameras poor and the Hotel do not want to know when you have been robbed. this is a very regular crime scene check web ! and the hotel tell you to park  ",10,November 2019
Novotel Bristol Centre,Training and exams - COVID SAFE,"I would like to thank the team at the Novotel Bristol Centre for their amazing work.  I ran an essential training course and exam for one of my clients.  The hotel is completely COVID-19 safe, clean, staff are very accommodating and friendly.

Novotel Bristol Centre,Lovely Hotel with Great Customer Service,"We were fortunate to be able to stay at the Novotel in Bristol during an essential work trip. We received a very warm welcome from Lynn. Our room itself was an experience, we had been booked into a suite which I would highly recommend, the suite had everything you could want for a stay and lots of room. The bedroom was separate with a large bed and large ensuite bathroom with a great shower and separate bath. It was obvious the room was prepared to COVID standards which was reassuring.   We were greeted by Iain in the morning and again we received a very friendly personal service. Again all the communal areas and conference area were clearly set up to ensure compliance with social distancing. There were more than enough hand cleaning stations. Each delegate was given a separate",50,February 2021
Novotel Bristol Centre,"Good hotel, easy walk to Bristol centre.","I stayed here for a weekend conference (at a different venue) and it was ideally located just a ten minute walk from the heart of Bristol. I had no problem parking my car in the underground car park and was welcomed by the staff at the hotel in a friendly and polite way when checking in. My room was large, clean and tidy and had everything you could want, desk, comfy chair, TV. It was decorated in a Japanese style/theme, which was interesting and unusual. I liked it, but the kimono hung like a crucifix above the headboard of the bed might have seemed odd to some people. The bed was comfy, I had a good night's sleep. The shower was nice and hot and the bathroom clean and tidy also.",40,January 2020
Novotel Bristol Centre,Great centrally located hotel,The hotel is centrally located within an easy walk of the city centre. There is a secure car park under the hotel. The rooms are quiet and clean. The staff were friendly. There is a good bar and breakfast was excellent.,50,October 2020
Novotel Bristol Centre,Great hotel and amazing service ,"I came to Novotel Bristol Centre with some friends to spend the weekend. The whole experience was perfect, our rooms were nice and spacious.

Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre,A taste of luxury,"My experience at this hotel over two weekend stays was wonderful.  Super comfortable bed and pillows, beautiful bathroom with delightful complimentary toiletries, shower easy to use and hot. Tea & coffee makinc facilities in the room which I always appreciate, and a small fridge as well. Staff were all friendly and helpful: reception, housekeeping, restaurant. Excellent advice on wine. Scrumptious breakfast. Great care taken with precautions against Covid 19 throughout the hotel.  A taste of luxury in difficult times.",50,September 2020
Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre,Lovely clean and comfortable hotel,"We arrived at 8.45 pm after leaving a nightmare hotel in Bath.  The guy on reception was really welcoming and asked the kitchen to stay open a bit longer for us (it closed at 9) until he’d checked us in.  Checkin was quick and easy and then we had lovely burger and fries.  When we went up to the room, it was sealed and spotlessly clean. Breakfast was nice and all the staff were very friendly, efficient and helpful. We had a lovely 2 night stay there and will definitely go back there again.",50,August 2020

Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre,Internet issues,"Travelling around UK this week so this is 3rd hotel in 4 nights but amazingly has same problem as the two premier inns stayed in.  The hotel is clean and decent but cannot give it more than 2 stars as no connection to internet, colleagues had same issue. Modern hotels should not have these issues. Disappointing to have score so low, grub was ok in restaurant decent but not special I would say.  Sort out your connection!",20,October 2020
Hilton Garden Inn Bristol City Centre,Not bad but probs wouldn’t come back,"Arrived in Bristol with my partner for the weekend. We were checked in quickly by a very friendly man and went to our room, it was very clean but smaller than a premier inn room that we had stayed ina few days before.   We went out for a few drinks in Bristol then came back for a couple in the hotel bar, the bar manager and staff were really accommodating and friendly and really made us feel welcome. On the first night we realised the bed wasn’t particularly comfy and pillows are feather (I believe) which means they deflate into nothing when you lay on them which led to a bad nights sleep.   On the second night I got some more pillows in the hope it would be comfort but alas they were still hopeless and after a night of tossing and turning I called reception in the middle of the",30,October 2020
Holiday Inn Bristol City Centre,"Broken aircon, blood on towels, staff with bad attitude!","I checked into my deluxe king room and the first thing I saw was a blood mark on a towel in the bathroom, I then realised the room was very hot and stuffy. The aircon had an error message and couldn't be adjusted. I phoned the reception and they offered to change rooms. I went to a different room on the same floor and went out. At 9pm I returned and my room was as hot and stuffy as the first room. The aircon was flashing with the same error message. The reception said the hotel was full (the hotel seemed empty!) and that it was too late to get a technician. She offered to send up a fan, but since you can't open the windows the room was hot and stuffy all night and I barely slept. The next morning I checked out and said to the receptionist that my aircon didn't work and my room",20,November 2020
Holiday Inn Bristol City Centre,Great city centre hotel,"We had a 2 night stay before the expected 2nd lockdown was announced and were nicely surprised with our experience here. Covid protocol was observed throughout all areas of the hotel by staff and guests. The Superior size room was far bigger and much better decorated than expected. Everything was spotlessly clean! All staff were helpful and friendly. Full breakfast selections were available and there was no limit on what you could have. Special thanks to Poppy for her buoyant and fun personality to start the day off! NOTE - NCP next door offers discounted rate @ £17.50 for 24 hours. However, check JustPark app for Cumberland Street secure parking at rear of hotel @ £15.00 for 48 hours. Tight spaces but much cheaper!",50,October 2020
Holiday Inn Bristol City Centre,A break with friends,"We stayed in the Holiday Inn for one night. The rooms were spotlessly clean, as were the bedding and towels. Good blackout curtains, modern bathroom with great shower. Tea making facilities. A five minute walk into the city centre. The bar (currently open until ten) was comfortable, and the breakfast was plentiful. Will definitely stay here again when we go to Bristol in the future. ",50,October 2020
Holiday Inn Bristol City Centre,Comfortable,"Using HIE instead of Airbnb or Booking.com, I gave this hotela try. Staying with my daughter, we had a twin bed room. It was clean and comfortable. The bathroom lock came lose so we couldn't use the lock.  All it needed was a hex headed key to secure the knob back on ‐ it didn't happen for 3 days. The window couldn't be opened either. We were offered another room,which we declined (have you tried moving a teenager with luggage once unpacked?). They gave us a complimentary drink at the bar.  Another downside of staying here is the huge cost of car parking. We used the hotel as a base so we walked around Bristol. We only used the car to visit Bath. It was cheaper for us to park on a local car park for £4.70 - overnight. It would have been nice to get offered a Bristol Street map.",40,October 2020
Holiday Inn Bristol City Centre,2 night stay after covid-19 lockdown ,"This is my opinion on a stay after lockdown.   Check in was quick, easy and early. Thanks for remembering my preferences.   1st night and 1st morning all really good.   Breakfast is still an all you can eat buffet the only differences are a reduced menu, although they still have alot on offer and the staff plate everything up for you. You just tell them what you would like..... Simple!   2nd morning Tuesday 22nd October. I feel really sorry for the lady I believe she was called Polly or Poppy I can't remember.   She was on her own but yet managed to cover everything.

Bristol Marriott Hotel City Centre,"Quality, clean hotel ","This was our first hotel booking since the coronavirus crisis, so we were a bit wary about the new procedures and how clean it would be. We stayed for 2 nights, Saturday and Sunday.   We were very impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel generally and of the rooms. The superior rooms were high quality and a nice size. Some of the hand sanitiser dispensers around the hotel needed refilling however, which is something the management need to keep an eye on. Guests were on the whole observing social distancing, and the bookings for breakfast were well managed. Tip: check in early if you would like a popular time for breakfast - for Sunday morning the latest available time slot was 7.45am by the time we checked in!  Breakfast was nicer on Day 1 rather than Day 2 which was a shame.",40,August 2020
Bristol Marriott Hotel City Centre,First day back and very impressed ,Not easy to open a hotel again from such a long break. Everything and everyone from clients to hotel staff made things seem very normal. Critics would say breakfast was very delayed but we bring our our fresh Italian coffee and fresh milk so no issue 😊,50,May 2020
Bristol Marriott Hotel City Centre,Great location,"The location is great, right next to Cabot  circus and the breakfast was fantastic!  There is a pool on the first floor behind the restaurant with a steam room and sauna available with the room rate which is quite a nice addition.  The rooms seem quite dated, and you can hear traffic from all angles which was not great.  The car park next door is very pricey at £17 for one night and not the nicest place to leave the car either.  We found a needle next to the space when we pulled in which was not pleasant and there were homeless sleeping in the stairwells.  All in all, a place of two extremes, I am not sure that we would stay again.",30,March 2020
Bristol Marriott Hotel City Centre,"Great staff, location and facilities","This hotel is in a great location. A 10 minute walk from Bristol Temple Meads train station and a short walk from the shops, restaurants and bars.  Check in was really good. The receptionist was really helpful.   The helpful and friendly staff were a constant throughout our stay whether in be in reception, the leisure club or the cleaners.  The room was a good size and really clean and quiet.  We used the leisure facilities and the gym is a good size. The pool area is nice along with the sauna and steam room.  I would definitely return to this hotel if back in Bristol.",50,March 2020
Future Inn Cabot Circus Hotel,Comfortable but lacking,"We arrived here to attend my brothers funeral on the 1st February 2021 at about 3pm. Check in was easy which was accompanied by the evening meal menu and breakfast menu choices. Our room was a suppior room which contained 2 double beds  and was easy on the eye. It was 3° outside and very similar inside. The room did not have any instructions for adjusting the air conditioning unit, how to contact reception or what to do in the event of a fire. After trying various settings and waiting so see if the room warmed, l went down to reception for instructions which were given verbally because of Covid. After an hour of trying various settings, and my wife now in bed to keep warm, l decided to contact t reception again. At that moment my wife informed me the toilet was not flushing",30,February 2021
Future Inn Cabot Circus Hotel,A 10-week business trip. ,"I (along with my colleagues), stayed here for a long period (I stayed the longest). We've all stayed in many hotels across the land, and found that the hotel offered a good mix of location, food and facilities. What really did lift the hotel above its competition was the level of friendliness and service shown by the staff, many of whom we would converse with as friends. I would have no hesitation in returning, but would recommend a room away from the main road, if a light-sleeper. The beds are amazing, the rooms very clean and the food is of excellent quality. I hope to return with my own family once covid lifts. ",50,December 2020
Future Inn Cabot Circus Hotel,Friendly and good value,"We stayed for the weekend and were impressed. The room was a good size (superior double) with bath and shower. The Covid restrictions were handled well and sensitively. We had breakfast and evening meal and, while not cordon bleu, the food was of good quality. All the staff were friendly and helpful especially Mark in the restaurant. The hotel is in an excellent location and it was great to have convenient parking included.  ",50,October 2020

Premier Inn Bristol City Centre (Haymarket) Hotel,Parking nightmare,"I pulled up to drop luggage off  i was welcome in and staff was great when i went to move the car but  unfortunately my car broke down, i called a mechanic once i then spoke to the staff who said they would send an email to parking company.  long story short on the 19th of December i received a letter from a debt collecting company demanding money for braking down in there carpark.  i am absolutely sick and would not and will NEVER stay with this company again.",10,November 2020
Premier Inn Bristol City Centre (Haymarket) Hotel,Good solid brand other side of lockdown,Very central and immediately adjacent to the older Broadmead shopping centre but the new Cabot Circus centre is co-joined.   This is a 17 storey 1960s style building so not the most attractive but provides great view across the city on the higher floors.  There is limited parking on the site  which is immediately accessible off the roundabout so you need to be aware when ready to turn off.    Not sure how many but I did not need to prove I was a Premier Inn customer to pay to park.  Cashless machine and can pay in various increments.  I paid for 24 hours at £15.00.  Excellent check-in as I was three hours early but they found me the family room.  As always nice and clean and spacious.  The two children had singles which they said were really comfortable.

Premier Inn Bristol City Centre (Haymarket) Hotel,Great central location,"The facade of the building is a bit of a seventies brutalist high rise architecture i.e. it ain't pretty.  However, location is excellent...bang in the centre of Bristol. Ideally situated for the Old City, which has some lovely bars and restaurants. If you fancy something a little edgier, the People's Republic of Stokes Croft is but a stones throw away - Caribbean food, graffiti and interesting watering holes to boot.  As will all Premier Inns, it was clean and quiet. Only minus points were a slightly leaking shower and no hot water early Saturday evening, which was a bit annoying.  Good value for our two night stay.",30,October 2020
Bristol Hotel,Cheap but not cheerful,"Having had our flight with Wizzair delayed overnight, we were sent to this hotel on the edge of the city. Wizzair clearly chose to select the cheapest accommodation possible and although the place was clean, it had very little else going for it.

Bristol Hotel,So needs an upgrade,"Stayed here for 2 nights, Location is perfect for the town centre etc but that is only if you can handle the traffic and people noise from outside. Online photographs are very deceiving as nothing looks the same. No where near as nice as in the photos. Hotel really needs a face lift. I liked a lot of the old artwork and old furniture but this hotel desperately needs a fresh coat of paint and the old carpets throughout need ripped out and nice flooring put in. Why would you have old carpets in a warm climate? The room was old and tired. 2 single beds, bed sheets were fresh and clean but both beds were equipped with old blankets and even older bed spreads which look as if they date back to the 60s or 70s. Furniture in room was old and tired and the 2 seater sofa in the room was so",20,November 2020

He lives in Wales and I live in England and with all the local lockdowns going on it has been a real struggle,  However, from 9th November 2020 the Welsh government advised that a household in Wales could form an extended household with a household in England... we were so happy that the governments finally gave us a break and made it possible for us to see each other.  All it asks is that whilst you are across the border, you comply with the local rules... so if he comes to England he has to comply with our current lockdown and when I am in Wales I have to comply with those rules.   So we booked a hotel as a nice treat to spend some time together.  However when I tried to check",20,November 2020

Premier Inn Bristol Sidcot (A38) hotel,In Interest of Fairness,"Well what to say .... I work away a lot and often stay in PI (business account) and my recent stay at Weston was appalling and I refuse to ever stay there again, BUT a short drive away is the complete opposite of the scale for PI.  Sidcot is clean, beautiful building, wonderful surroundings and above all the staff were some of the friendliest and helpful I’ve met (on par with Nuneaton).  I will definitely be returning and will come back and visit for a weekend too (when allowed).  Well worth a visit for a quite, cheap room with great staff.

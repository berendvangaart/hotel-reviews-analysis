The feeling of a small town is very nice.","Considering the times we are living I expect more than a tiny bar of soap. There should be ample supplies of liquid soap and hand sanitiser.
Also in the hygiene department the dishwasher simply does not clean dishes. Very frustrating.

We took the luxury accommodation, which was sufficient.","The mattresses were sinking in the middle, if you picked up the carpet in the living room, there was dirt there that indicated it wasn't cleaned for a while, the cleaning material they provide are not sufficient, especially given you don't get cleaning services during your stay (just bring your own cleaning kit), the jacuzzi didn't work and sauna took very long to heat.

Beautiful „Village“ in Maastricht
","Just a leap from the centrum of Maastricht lies this little village of holiday houses. It is quiet, green and really beautiful.
The house itself is modern and new, we felt at ease immediately. The beds and the couch were comfortable, the house had a private parking spot, blinds and a bathtub in addition to the shower.
The staff at the reception and the food court was really polite and kind, it was a pleasure.","First of all: the cost per dog and per stay is not mentioned here. We were a little shocked by the 40€ per dog per stay!
You could see in several spots that the cleaning staff is not quite thorough: the bathtub was dirty as well as the dustbin and the blinds. But the park was really clean as well as the house in general.
In total it was a great stay in a beautiful place. The only things that we were missing were a blanket on the couch and a dvd player in the house.", 7.9 ,"

Afterall, guests are spending time in the room more than restaurants and we had to repeatedly order hot water, tea, coffee with charges.

Fabulous
","The property is new & well maintained. Very clean, the decor  simple & stylish. We had a fully equipped kitchen - basic supply of utensils, pots & pans, plates and glasses in very good condition. 
Our three bedroom apartment was very comfortable with a large dinning table with chairs, lounge area - tv area, one spacious bathroom & two toilets which came in handy with a large family. The hydronic heating worked well & served our family well especially on the cold days. 
The staff were friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful time & highly recommend but next time we may consider hiring a car. ",Mattress is new but too soft. Not enough back support - latex mattress?  The accomodation was a bit far from Maastricht city centre. From the apartment we needed to walk about 30 - 40 mins into town or a taxi - 10 min drive about 20 - 25 euros in a van one way (for 6 people).

Great and highly recommended
","Kasteel hoogenweerth is a combination of class, tranquility and great service. It doesn't hurt that the location is only 5 min drive from the city centre and well connected by a bus. We booked the deluxe room which was extremely clean and exuded luxury and had its own private entrance. The kitchen had 4 hobs, espresso machine and was well equipped with cutlery.The staff was really friendly and available and acted on any feedback very quickly. Due to corona most of the restaurants were closed, so we were happy to eat at their pop-up restaurant. We had dinner here 2 nights in a row, one of them being the opening night. We requested vegetarian menu which they happily accommodated, even though it took them 2 tries to get the quantity right. Overall highly recommended and would definitely come back.",There were cobwebs in the room as its an old castle but they were promptly removed. The pop-up restaurant took two tries to get our food right, 9.0 ,"

-the kitchen could be a bit more equipped, more cutlery and dishes, kitchen towels and cleaning stuff.
-in the upper floor of our suite there was an Eames chaise long placed randomly under a bar for hanging clothes. That made the room look a bit like a very expensive storage attic.

Very good
","The room was very spacious, even bigger than expected with two bedrooms in it, beds were comfortable. Breakfast is brought to the room because of COVID19, and has quite a lot of things, I liked it (I prefer this over a buffet to be honest). There is a small natural area nearby with some wild horses, nice to have a walk.","The bathroom was tiny. The minibar only has a few drinks, wouldn't call it a minibar. Breakfast was too expensive for what we got. The couch in the bedroom wasn't looking clean and had a small stain on it. The floor with the bedrooms was very hot and stuffy and there was no way to keep the ceiling window open to let the fresh air in (there's an AC to cool it down, but it will still be stuffy). What I didn't like was that it wasn't actually possible to see the castle even from the outside, as the territory is gated, despite no ongoing event in sight (and all that while they put castle pics on the hotel website). :(", 8.0 ,"

Big room with large windows, nice decorations, comfortable bed, a proper place to eat your takeaway food in covid times is available (in the room where the breakfast is arranged).","There was a good layer of dust on the floor. Walked without shoes and my black socks got dirty immediately. The noise isolation is not great either as we could constantly hear the beeping of the traffic light which was in front of our window. But I must admit we slept well - there is not much traffic after midnight luckily. The breakfast was also not great - I think a simple choice between scrambled eggs/fruits & yoghurt/meats&cheese with bread/pastries would be easy to accommodate and would make customers happier. We do not eat meat and the staff was nice and was bringing vegetable spreads to replace it. But for breakfast I like having fried/scrambled eggs and those were not an option. I had instead yoghurt & croissant, which was ok but not my preference.", 8.0 ,"

Beautiful building, special breakfast & good location
","- We had a quite room on the topfloor with beautiful wooden elements, it was very spacious, so it felt a bit like a loft. The beds were really comfy.
- The location is great, just around the corner is one of the key squares of Maastricht with bars, restaurants and shops. From there you can walk to the entire old centre
- The breakfast was delicious and special! A cava, a steak and marinated salmon is not something you get every day and the breakfast room is very pretty.
- It is possible to park your car at the hotel parking against payment.","- sometimes an odd smell came into the room, probably from the kitchen downstairs (through the small window) or from the airco
- there is no elevator - which for us wasn’t a problem, but it could be for others", 9.0 ,"

We enjoyed our stay and we have done most of our photoshoot .
I have my peace and quiet that i need to concentrate with my coming collections.","When we booked the hotel is for my daughter who is turning 18 to stay away to concentrate with her clothing range to  be  launched  in July ..  i mentioned in my email that at the same time it was my daughters 18th birthday and she will taking  pictures inside the room.
When we arrived at the hotel reception, the receptionist told us that 3 person are allowed in the room to stay the whole 2 days stay, so we filled the form with the 3 person names who are staying .As the girls want foods from outside We asked the receptionist if we are allowed to bring foods inside the hotel and they said yes. I inform the receptionist that there will be another girl coming during the day and they said it will be ok.
When the girls are checking out, The lady receptionist in the name she said is Aeriel , questioned nastily the girl why they have a box of cake , then she said why you are 3 persons stayed in that room , only allowed 2. The girls were scared. I went inside to talk to the receptionist , i told her that before she open her mouth and tell the girls off..she should have looked at the check in paper that we filled, or  asked the other receptionists if they allowed the girls to have foods inside. She should have more accommodating rather than nasty. We always use  hotels for  special occasions for families and clients and we never had a bad record and always follow rules and regulations. 
I think that your staff Aeriel  a receptionist will disappoint your clients and will give a bad name of your hotel.
I hope that you give attention to this email as we the clients are your business.", 8.0 ,"

He shook his head when I showed my photo i.d., unprofessiional and unacceptable behaviour.
I had a legally permitted reason that allowed my booking.
I had an appt first thing the next morning which was seriously impacted by the man's mysoginy.
The next day, the Weds the woman on reception who was there until I checked out Sat was professional and had no issue with my booking. I'm grateful she knows her job.
Due to the young man, I cannot book the hotel again or recommend it.
I am a repeat hotel customer and the young mam has detrimentally impacted the business of the hotel.

Lovely staff, great big jacuzzi Bath, not very clean
","Loved theme, staff, facilities as in restaurant, look, mostly location except difficult to drive to I found. Loved jacuzzi Bath. ","I didn’t like weird partly broken handle on toilet where you had to spin it all the way round to flush, weird. I also didn’t like the cleanliness and broken heating in room so they put a cheap heater in corner which brought down the aesthetic massively. When I say not clean, I had to clean myself. Loads of black bits and fluff all over carpet by bed, bathroom floor, bath itself, rusting around plug didn’t help as that went in your Bath. The dressing table also had marks on and needed to be cleaned as well as toilet. Due to this the smell in the room was off which isn’t the nicest. Overall as it’s under new management and this hotel has lots of potential I didn’t want to give a bad score but I also wanted to be honest. I have attached some pictures (only allowed 4 so some are of cleanliness and last one of lovely Bath. FYI my stay was over a month ago now in December. ", 7.0 ,"

We then moved to the Astor Wing on the second night, in which we had a spectacular room with real old world charm. Can highly recommend the Henry VIII pub for dinner in the evening.","There was a bit of confusion with our booking and the room we'd book wasn't available when we arrived.

",Good service clean rooms room service only all good ,"My only negative is the rooms are cold the heating is off in the rooms.  I reported this to the reception as I stay here often and recently the rooms have been cold.  This is an old building the windows aren’t double glazed and the doors aren’t draught proofed.  The heating took for ever to come on and I was cold through the night despite plugging in a small oil radiator that was in the room.  In the morning, none of the plug sockets worked and the tv wouldn’t come on I think a fuse had blown somewhere.
I was leaving very early so didn’t get the chance to report this to the staff

Beautiful venue, wonderful facilities, shame about the children.
",The surroundings and buildings were stunning. Everything was spotlessly clean. The bathroom in our room was beautiful. the spa facilities were calm and welcoming. We loved the open fires and the bar area was great,"The service at breakfast was poor, had to wait a long time for service and didn't actually receive everything we ordered. We weren't keen on children being in the spa. We felt that this was an opportunity for adults only to enjoy the pool area as Champneys has a reputation for being a holistic wellbeing retreat, it didn't seem appropriate that children could play in the pool.", 8.0 ,"

Every kitchen I have ever seen has potatoes! Service was extremely slow, and had to wait 25 minutes to get a drink. Were not offered any assistance with suitcases and had to take them ourselves to the Mews, over dark and uneven paths. I am 78 and my daughter has COPD, so this was poor.

Beautiful hotel, severly understaffed
",Beautiful hotel and location.,"Dinner - Was so understaffed had 2 waitresses looking after around 20 tables. We were guests but couldnt get a restaurant booking, nor could many other guests - so many ate with us in bar rooms. 
Food in bar was also poor, we were served wrong dishes with fruit with actual mould as garnish.
Breakfast - At breakfast we were severed cold cheese which was slicked in sweat and also had to be changed. Staff were apologetic and again had 2 wait staff in a breakfast room full of people.
Spa - Spa had again around 15 rooms worth of people and 2 staff present. Also only found out on the day as we didnt book a spa package - we could only use spa late at night and early am.", 7.0 ,"

Lovely manor/location but in need of work
","Great location, beautiful countryside and historic old house with impressive grounds. The staff were generally friendly and helpful.
","The room was tired and in need of an update, although very spacious. Parts of the hotel are in need of repair (broken floorboards/window panes etc). The food was hit and miss, some things were ok, other food items were not great. The food/drinks are also expensive with some items being very poor quantity for the price (although you have to appreciate the setting you are eating in and the impact on costs). Spa was disappointing, limited access and on entry very hot and crowded, we didn’t even get in the pool. Massage was ok but not great, especially at that price point.

Lovely bathroom with free standing bath and double shower. Very clean!
As I was there for work during lock down, there was no-one else around so the hotel was very quiet. Would be nice to return when the bar/restaurant are open and see what breakfast has to offer - however the breakfast packs provided were great for breakfast and lunch (included a sandwich and crisps!) - I suppose a hotel breakfast would usually fill you up until dinner anyway!
Friendly staff member at reception - he was very chatty and told me everything I needed to know.
The hotel is well positioned, spotlessly clean and in a beautiful building in one of the best areas of Folkestone.
Thank you!! ","The only improvements I can think of would be to include a fridge in the room (suite) and glasses as well as mugs.
